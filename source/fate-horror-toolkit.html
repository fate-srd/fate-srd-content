<h1>Chapter 1: Gazing Into The Abyss</h1>
<div class="subheader">Introduction and How to Use This Book</div>
<p>Many roleplaying games are lightly spiced with disturbing or scary elements intended to thrill and entertain their players.</p>
<p>Others draw on the rich tradition of horror fiction to pose awful moral dilemmas, offer existential threats at every turn, and tell stories saturated with tension and dread.</p>
<p>Such games gaze into the abyss and challenge it to gaze back&mdash;if it dares.</p>
<h5>Horror Doesn&rsquo;t Excuse Being Horrible</h5>
<p>The horror genre has been used to great effect in exploring and validating the consequences of systemic bigotry and, unfortunately, sometimes endorsing it. In horror fiction, women and members of minority groups are often depicted as perpetual victims or as &ldquo;getting what&rsquo;s coming to them.&rdquo; The purpose of this book is not to legitimize or enable this kind of exploitative horror&mdash;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re playing horror&rdquo; is not a license to behave horribly. The tools we provide here are for exploring scary stories where characters of every kind must deal with horrific events, terrifying threats, violation, betrayal, and emotional and physical vulnerability.</p>
<h2>The Anatomy of a Horror Game</h2>
<p>The goal of the <i class="title">Fate Horror Toolkit</i> is to give you the tools to run effective horror games in Fate Core. However, before we don our leather aprons and open our stained roll of sharp and terrifying instruments, let&rsquo;s review the vital parts of a successful horror game.</p>
<h3>Horror Requires Player Investment</h3>
<p>All horror requires investment from the audience. Movies and TV can get a head start on this by using music, lighting, jump-scares, and other cues as shortcuts to the viewer&rsquo;s fight-or-flight response, while books have the luxury of a one-on-one relationship with the reader and plenty of time to get into their head.</p>
<p>Roleplaying games don&rsquo;t have it so easy. They&rsquo;re an inherently social activity, making it much more difficult to achieve an atmosphere fully conducive to horror. You can use music and props to help you build the mood, but without the enthusiastic cooperation and investment of the players, your efforts are doomed to failure.</p>
<p>A successful horror game provides tools and advice that facilitate player investment in the horror themes of the game, and minimizes distractions that make this harder to achieve.</p>
<h3>Horror Is Transgressive</h3>
<p>The beating heart of horror is violation. Nothing and no one is safe, and the more important something is to the characters, the more likely it is to be corrupted, mutilated, or destroyed. Morals are tarnished and buckle under the weight of unspeakable dilemmas. People and things the characters love betray them, or are twisted, broken, and torn apart. Horror is a crucible from which nothing emerges unscathed.</p>
<h3>Horror Is Isolating</h3>
<p>Horror fiction systematically isolates its protagonists from anyone or anything that can help them, leaving them nobody to rely on but themselves. Sometimes it goes even further, eliminating the protagonists one at a time until the last survivor faces a desperate struggle to survive against insurmountable odds.</p>
<p>In a horror game, the player characters find it difficult to persuade anyone to help them, or their helpers meet grisly fates. The existence of their adversaries is difficult to prove. At best the authorities view the characters as confused or dishonest, at worst they&rsquo;re seen as menaces to be handled accordingly.</p>
<p>Presuming, of course, that the authorities aren&rsquo;t already owned by the adversary.</p>
<p>A game can be isolating without employing a high player character mortality rate, but if characters are expected to die regularly&mdash;such as when evoking a <i class="title">Halloween</i>-style slasher movie&mdash;the game needs to provide options for keeping the players of dead characters involved and engaged in the game.</p>
<h3>Horror Is Disempowering</h3>
<p>Horror is closely associated with feelings of hopelessness and despair. Without conflict there would be no drama, but the conflicts of horror fiction are unfair and overwhelming. If the characters are adequately prepared and equipped to cope, it takes us away from horror and into thriller territory.</p>
<p>Characters don&rsquo;t have to be incompetent, but they do have to be outmatched by horrendous adversaries, disempowered due to their circumstances or a lack of appropriate knowledge, or have their coping tools stripped from them over the course of the game.</p>
<p>Failure is always a possibility, and sometimes doom is inevitable. In other cases the characters are able to rally before the end of the story, gaining the tools and support they need to fight back and, perhaps, win the day.</p>
<h3>Horror Thrives on Uncertainty and Suspense</h3>
<p>Ignorance may be bliss, but its cousin uncertainty is surely not. While ignorance reflects absence of knowledge, uncertainty derives from partial knowledge and is the root of suspense&mdash;a state of anxious uncertainty about past, present, or future events.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all familiar with the corrosive effects of everyday suspense. Will I be a victim of the current round of job layoffs? Is my partner having an affair? Is the shadow on my chest X-ray a tumor or a benign cyst?</p>
<p>Horror turns suspense up to eleven, often in a way that exaggeratedly reflects real-life fears. Why have my work colleagues been disappearing after they go to their &ldquo;performance reviews&rdquo;? Is my partner really my partner, or is he an identical replacement that&rsquo;s subtly wrong? Is the shadow on my chest X-ray a tumor or a horrifying <em class="Emphasis">thing</em> that&rsquo;s slowly gnawing its way out of my body?</p>
<p>Effective horror games give enough information to the players for them to be anxious without giving everything away at once, because suspense relies heavily on ambiguity and partial information.</p>
<h2>Player Consent and Safety</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve stated that horror games require player investment and are transgressive, isolating, and disempowering. They ask players to make themselves vulnerable and then actively work to make them feel anxious and uncomfortable while exploring dark and troubling themes.</p>
<p>All of this makes horror gaming a potentially harmful experience. The intensity of a scene might be too much for some players; one of you might experience a panic attack due to game events stirring up the past, or you might accidentally invoke a player&rsquo;s phobia with one of your descriptions. In a worst-case scenario, someone might use your horror game to legitimize or conceal deliberate abuse of another player.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your responsibility as the GM to work with the group to create an enjoyable horror experience with the players&rsquo; enthusiastic consent, and to ensure they have the tools to manage their own safety.</p>
<h3>Before You Begin the Game</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Be certain that your group is comfortable with horror themes in general and specifically the ones you plan to use in your game. Some players will want to establish hard rules about scenes they won&rsquo;t accept&mdash;such as portrayals of violence against children or animals&mdash;while others will accept the possibility of troubling content in the game but will ask you to draw a veil or fade to black rather than employing full and gruesome detail.</li>
	<li>To ensure there are no objections, discuss the specific rules you intend to adopt to evoke horror.</li>
	<li>Discuss and explore a framework that can be used during the game by players to control their experience and protect themselves. Some players won&rsquo;t know in advance what they can and cannot tolerate, or might change their minds during play. It&rsquo;s also easy to get carried away during the game and overstep boundaries set by some of your players, so you need a mechanism to allow the group to get back on track.</li>
	<li>If you&rsquo;re playing a convention game with strangers, the X-Card system by John Stavropoulos is a good option as it allows players to call a halt to a situation or description without explanation. If you&rsquo;re gaming with a group of people who know and trust each other a bit better, the Script Change system by Beau Jager Sheldon allows for more nuanced control over scenes and for a degree of conversation about what is problematic and why.</li>
</ul>
<h3>During Play</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Don&rsquo;t deliberately exploit the players&rsquo; genuine fears to get an easy scare unless you&rsquo;ve discussed it with them first and received their explicit and enthusiastic consent.</li>
	<li>Consent given once does not imply blanket consent for the same thing forever. Even if a player has previously been okay with an element in the game, listen to them if they ask you to stop using it from now on. If you use a tool like <strong class="terminology">intensity aspects</strong> from the beginning of the game but a player becomes uncomfortable with them, stop using that tool.</li>
	<li>Ensure you listen when players use the X-Card or call for a Script Change or otherwise express their desire to bypass or address something they are finding too uncomfortable.</li>
	<li>While the X-Card or Script Change tools allow players to take control over their own safety and to call for content changes, it is still your responsibility as the GM to ensure that everyone is having a good time. If a player is visibly getting very uncomfortable but hasn&rsquo;t said anything, don&rsquo;t assume they are okay just because they haven&rsquo;t used a tool; call a brief break and check in with them privately to be sure.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Themed or modified fate points: Communal fate point pool, monster pool</li>
	<li>Modified or thematic compels: Enhanced self-compels, visceral compels, climactic dilemmas</li>
	<li>Declaring story details: Reconstruction</li>

</ul>
<h5>Conditions in the Fate Horror Toolkit</h5>
<p>In several places in this book, we use conditions as defined on page 116 of <i class="title">Dresden Files Accelerated</i>. If you don&rsquo;t have access to <i class="title">Dresden Files Accelerated</i>, you can refer to the rules for conditions on page 18 of the <i class="title">Fate System Toolkit</i> or at <em class="Emphasis">https://fate-srd.com/fate-system-toolkit/conditions</em>. The main difference is that a <i class="title">Dresden Files Accelerated</i> condition is not an aspect unless the text specifically says it is.</p>
<h2>Resources for Horror in Fate Core</h2>
<p>The following books and articles are useful companions to the tools we present here:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <i class="title">Fate Accessibility Toolkit</i>&mdash;Discusses X-Cards and veils in greater detail.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;The Horror Paradox&rdquo; in the <i class="title">Fate System Toolkit</i>&mdash;Explores changes you can make to the base Fate system to make it a better fit for horror-themed games.</li>

<h1>Chapter 2: The Raveled Sleeve of Care</h1>
<div class="subheader">Encouraging Player Investment and Creating Sympathetic Characters and NPCs</div>
<p>For your players to get the most out of your horror game, it&rsquo;s critical that they fully invest themselves in their characters and assist you in building and sustaining the necessary mood. The tools provided in this chapter are designed to help you achieve this.</p>
<p>A failing of many horror stories is that their characters are so poorly drawn or so unlikable that the audience doesn&rsquo;t care what happens to them. Much of the advice we provide here is dedicated to ensuring that the characters and NPCs in your game are sympathetic and fully realized, helping you create an effective horror experience.</p>
<h2>Media Inspiration</h2>
<p>The following books, movies, and TV shows were useful sources of inspiration when we were compiling the advice in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The main characters in the film <i class="title">Insidious</i> are smart and likable and the tension of their situation is built expertly to make you really care for them.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Revival</i>, <i class="title">Doctor Sleep</i>, and many other Stephen King books rely on building your sympathy for the protagonists to make the tension more effective. Many of King&rsquo;s protagonists are flawed but likable characters as a result.</li>
	<li>If you didn&rsquo;t care what happened to the survivors in <i class="title">The Walking Dead</i>, there would be no drama. Also a great inspiration for <span class="chapter-title">The High Cost of L</span><span class="chapter-title">iving</span>.</li>
	<li><i class="title">The Red Tree</i> by Caitlin Kiernan&mdash;Lovecraft via a feminist lens&mdash;and <i class="title">Monstress</i> by Marjorie Liu &amp; Sana Takeda are great inspiration for the Sensual Horror material.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Saw</i>, <i class="title">Drag Me to Hell</i>, and <i class="title">The Purge</i> are all modern movies that pose interesting moral dilemmas amid the carnage.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Button, Button</i> by Richard Matheson was made into a movie called <i class="title">The Box</i> and provides an interesting moral dilemma to chew over.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Sophie&rsquo;s Choice</i> by William Styron features one of the most terrible and heart-wrenching moral dilemmas in all of fiction. It was adapted into a movie starring Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Ringu</i> (<i class="title">The Ring</i> in the English language remake) features a sympathetic protagonist trying to survive against a terrifying supernatural threat which is, itself, a victim.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Let the Right One In</i> is unusual in that it builds and maintains sympathy for a monster even when the extent of their monstrousness is revealed.</li>
	<li><i class="title">The Cabin in the Woods</i> gleefully lampshades and inverts common horror tropes but still manages to build sympathy for the characters as they try to survive the events of the movie.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Game Creation</h2>
<p>The first step of game creation is to talk to your players about the issues we discuss in <span class="chapter-title">&ldquo;Player Consent and Safety&rdquo;</span>. Knowing that there are boundaries to what can and cannot be expressed in the game gives players a base level of comfort and allows them to really throw themselves into the game.</p>
<p>Next, discuss the style, genre, and major themes of horror you intend to evoke and ensure that all the players are enthusiastically on board. If one of your players is bored with zombie stories, it&rsquo;s unlikely that you&rsquo;ll be able to fully engage them in a<i class="title"> Walking Dead</i> style survival horror game and you&rsquo;ll be better off finding something else that interests the entire group.</p>
<p>Creating the game&rsquo;s setting and issue aspects together is a good way to get everyone on the same page about the broad strokes of the horror that&rsquo;s to come. This a good opportunity for players to discuss where their current limits for disturbing content lie.</p>
<p>Take the time to discuss the altered rules you&rsquo;ll be using for your game. This is another good opportunity to obtain enthusiastic consent and buy-in from the players for the various tools that reinforce horror conventions, giving you the comfort to employ them without worrying that players may react badly to them in play. If a player objects to any of the tools you intend to use, discuss whether it can be amended to relieve their discomfort with it... but ultimately no horror tool is worth more than the comfort of your players. If you can&rsquo;t reach agreement, drop the tool or switch to a different type of horror game that doesn&rsquo;t rely on the contentious tool.</p>
<h2>Character Creation</h2>
<p>Players usually become attached to their own character during the process of character creation, so your goal is to ensure that they also invest in and become attached to the other PCs. That means making them interesting and sympathetic.</p>
<p>You can learn a lot about what makes a character sympathetic&mdash;and the opposite&mdash;from books, movies, and TV. Certain character traits can make a likable character into a beloved favorite or make even an unpleasant character enjoyable&mdash;that&rsquo;s how we get magnificent bastards, antiheroes, and lovable rogues. You can blend game mechanics and storytelling techniques to showcase and reinforce these traits.</p>
<p>Fate Core is designed to create characters who are competent and proactive and somewhat larger than life, whereas horror fiction usually features characters who are more grounded. You don&rsquo;t have to make any significant changes to the character creation process to reflect this, but consider the characters through a horror lens and ensure the aspects, skills, and stunts each player takes are appropriate to the type of game you&rsquo;re running and the nature of the characters they&rsquo;re playing.</p>
<h3>Choosing Aspects</h3>
<p>Ask players to come up with grounded high concepts and other aspects. If a player suggests the high concept aspect <strong class="aspect">Elite Soldier</strong> for their character, you might propose <strong class="aspect">Grizzled Veteran</strong> or <strong class="aspect">Experienced Infantryman</strong> as alternatives.</p>
<h4>Vulnerabilities and Flaws</h4>
<p>We often identify strongly with characters who have made mistakes, who have overwhelming or destructive needs, or who are flawed or vulnerable in some way, but who are doing their best to get on with life regardless.</p>
<p>These things aren&rsquo;t just for trouble aspects. The best aspects are double-edged, and introducing a flaw or a darker twist into an otherwise beneficial aspect is a good way to encourage compels while also making it easier to sympathize with the affected character.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Nick&rsquo;s character Rufio isn&rsquo;t just skeptical, he&rsquo;s <strong class="aspect">Skeptical to a </strong><strong class="aspect">Fault</strong>.</blockquote>
<p>People can also be vulnerable because of their physical limitations. The elderly and children are typical examples of this in horror fiction, as are people with a reduced ability to see, hear, or move about under their own power. If you use this approach, it is important to treat the subject with respect. For more about playing characters with physical limitations, see the <i class="title">Fate Accessibility To</i><i class="title">olkit</i>.</p>
<h4>Linked Aspects</h4>
<p>Aspects that link to other player characters or NPCs (such as the ones chosen during the traditional Phase Trio, <i class="title">Fate Core System</i>, page 38) are extremely useful for building a bond between the characters that you can later leverage to evoke horror themes.</p>
<h3>Choosing Skills</h3>
<p>When reviewing each character, ensure that their Good (+3) and Great (+4) skills are adequately justified by their aspects. It makes sense for a <strong class="aspect">Grizzled Veteran</strong> to have Shoot at Great (+4), but a <strong class="aspect">Jaded English Teacher </strong>shouldn&rsquo;t unless he has another aspect, like <strong class="aspect">Weekend Hunter and Outdoo</strong><strong class="aspect">rsman</strong>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more difficult to isolate characters with high Resources or Contacts skills from sources of support (whether that&rsquo;s allies or expensive equipment) so consider deleting these skills from the list for your game or applying higher opposition than usual when the players use them&mdash;but make sure you tell your players in advance if you&rsquo;re doing this.</p>
<h3>Choosing Stunts</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t allow stunts that undermine the horror themes of your game. For example, the stunt Always Making Useful Things (<i class="title">Fate Core System</i>, page 103) makes it much more difficult to isolate a character from their tools and other useful items.</p>
<p>Instead, encourage players to take stunts for their characters that have a darker or more cynical tint to them in keeping with horror themes. A good example is Lies Upon Lies (<i class="title">Fate Core System</i>, page 104), which makes it easier to lie to someone who has already believed one of your lies in the current session.</p>
<h2>During Play</h2>
<p>These tools will help you to sustain and increase the players&rsquo; investment in the game and in the characters and NPCs that inhabit it during play.</p>
<h3>Creating Uncertainty and Suspense</h3>
<p>To build suspense, avoid giving everything away to the players from the beginning of a scenario. Choose aspects that hint at the truth rather than reveal it, and adapt them during play as the characters uncover more information about the situation.</p>
<blockquote class="example">You begin your game with a series of grisly killings, and the players&rsquo; investigations lead them to believe that an <strong class="aspect">Outsized Dog</strong> is responsible. Of course, the perpetrator is actually a <strong class="aspect">Cursed Lycant</strong><strong class="aspect">hrope</strong>.</blockquote>
<p>You can turn the availability of information in Fate Core to your advantage in scaring your players. As Alfred Hitchcock pointed out, there is a big difference between surprise and suspense, and the latter is a more effective way to scare your players. If two players are at a scene in a restaurant when a bomb suddenly explodes, they are surprised and probably horrified, but there has been no suspense. If instead you describe the bomb under the table as they sit down and occasionally mention as an aside that the number on its timer is ticking ever closer to zero, you build tension and suspense that keeps them on the edge of their seat.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Ed&rsquo;s GMing his horror game <i class="title">Morts</i> and he says, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something about this building that gives you a bad feeling, but you can&rsquo;t really say why. Oh, by the way, I&rsquo;m just going to put this situation aspect here, <strong class="aspect">Hiding in the Shadows</strong> with two free invokes. It&rsquo;s nothing to do with any of you. It&rsquo;s probably nothing, don&rsquo;t worry about it. Anyway, what do you do next?&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>Incomplete information is a great way to generate tension. In <i class="title">Aliens</i>, the Marines know exactly how far away the xenomorphs are and how fast they&rsquo;re moving, but can&rsquo;t track them in three-dimensional space, allowing for an amazingly tense scene where they realize that the aliens are in the ductwork immediately above them.</p>
<h3>Managing the Game&rsquo;s Tension Level&mdash;The Heartbeat of Horror</h3>
<p>Horror fiction is often constructed with a recognizable pattern that would look a bit like a heartbeat if you plotted it on a graph. Each moment of intense threat is followed by a lull in which the tension stays at a baseline or builds slowly, letting the audience catch their breath and anticipate the next moment of tension.</p>
<p>This is also vital to your horror game. If you keep the tension level high all the time, you&rsquo;ll burn players out and they&rsquo;ll start to disconnect from the game. Keep the heartbeat in mind while you&rsquo;re planning or running the game and ensure that each scene of high tension is followed by a more relaxed scene in which the players and their characters can take a breather or perhaps even have a laugh or two. They will continue to anticipate the horror during the lull and it will make the impact of the next high tension scene much more effective.</p>
<p>As your scenario builds towards its climax, make the lulls shorter and increase the intensity of the threat in each tense scene so the heartbeat of your game gets faster and faster. Then, at the climax, go wild with a long scene with an extended and highly exaggerated threat and your players will be sitting on the edges of their seats.</p>
<p>The first <i class="title">Paranormal Activity</i> movie is a masterful example of the heartbeat of horror in action. The daytime scenes start out being quite calm and unthreatening because we know the &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; only manifests at night, but the things the characters witness on the video build a low level of unsettling tension and anticipation. The night scenes start out with relatively low-intensity spikes of horror at the start of the movie, growing longer and more intense as the situation escalates, until the long and extremely tense scene at the end of the movie.</p>
<h3>Overwhelming the Player Characters</h3>
<p>The players will invest more in the horror themes of your game if they feel as though their characters are genuinely threatened by whatever dangers they face. Your object is generally not to kill the PCs, but to ensure that their adversaries feel overwhelmingly vast and dangerous&mdash;at least, until they find or develop the tools to have a chance at standing against them.</p>
<p>Sometimes the PCs are unable to even challenge a horrific menace on its own terms. If they&rsquo;re hounded by a demonic apparition, the first few times they encounter it they won&rsquo;t have any tools they can use against it; the very best they can hope to expect is to get away with their lives, health, and sanity.</p>
<p>Be sure to challenge the PCs with robust opposition. In any high tension scene, use opposition from +0 to +3 over the current apex skill to increase the costs of victory and make a concession or defeat more likely.</p>
<h3>Making Player Character Death Count</h3>
<p>As we say in <span class="chapter-title">Gazing Into the Abyss</span>, a horror game doesn&rsquo;t <em class="Emphasis">have</em> to be more lethal to player characters than any other. However, player character death is more likely than in many other genres, and some types of horror are predicated upon the morbid reality that everyone dies eventually. You can use the following two systems to make character deaths a significant moment in your game and to give fallen characters a legacy that continues to affect the game.</p>
<h4>Heroic Sacrifice</h4>
<p>The <strong class="terminology">heroic sacrifice</strong> is a special form of concession. Like any other concession, a player can only choose to do this while they haven&rsquo;t been taken out and before the dice hit the table on a current action. When they heroically sacrifice their character, they will die and there is no way for this to be prevented. The player gets to describe the circumstances of their PC&rsquo;s death in as much detail as they like, adding reasonable story details as necessary, and can achieve one of the following results in addition to their glorious demise:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Take out a mob of nameless NPCs</li>
	<li>Take out a supporting NPC</li>
	<li>Force a named NPC to take a severe consequence. If the NPC has already taken a severe consequence, make them take an extreme one instead. If they have already taken an extreme consequence, take them out.</li>
	<li>If the group agrees, immediately end an ongoing conflict. This is a form of group concession and means the PCs don&rsquo;t fulfill their objectives for the conflict. The sacrifice allows them to escape without any further ill effects, letting them lick their wounds and try again later. The PCs receive fate points for the concession as normal.</li>
	<li>If the group agrees it makes sense, the dying PC immediately overcomes a single obstacle without a roll, regardless of the opposition against them.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a player chooses to heroically sacrifice their character, they can&rsquo;t create a new one until the end of the scenario. However, their character can live on through a <strong class="terminology">legacy aspect</strong> (see the next section) and/or as a <strong class="terminology">ghost</strong> as suggested.</p>
<h4>Legacy Aspects</h4>
<p>You can use this system whether a PC makes a heroic sacrifice or dies through any other circumstance in the game. Once the remaining player characters have had a chance to take a breather and commiserate over the character&rsquo;s death, they can take a <strong class="terminology">legacy aspect</strong> to represent the lasting impact of the fallen on their lives.</p>
<p>This is a group aspect that embodies the lasting example set by the fallen. If the player of the fallen character has not been able to create a new character, give them two free invokes on their fallen aspect each session that they can use to aid their living companions.</p>
<p>Only allow one legacy aspect for each <em class="Emphasis">player</em>. If a player loses two characters, the group can have a legacy aspect relating to either character, but not both.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Rufio heroically sacrifices himself to permanently blind the werewolf who was stalking the group. Later that night, the remaining characters share a drink in his honor and reflect on what he taught them. The group creates a legacy aspect for Rufio of <strong class="aspect">Fortune Favors the Bold</strong>. As Rufio heroically sacrificed himself, Nick can&rsquo;t make a new character until the end of the scenario...but he does get two free invokes on Rufio&rsquo;s legacy aspect to aid his fellow players and he can play Rufio as a ghost if he wants to.</blockquote>
<h4>Haunting</h4>
<p>A player can bring back their departed character as a <strong class="terminology">ghost</strong>. Ghosts can appear even in games that don&rsquo;t have any active supernatural elements. There&rsquo;s a rich tradition in drama where the ghosts are the living characters&rsquo; subconscious trying to communicate to their conscious selves, allegorical representations, or manifestations of guilt and internal struggle. Ghosts of this sort can&rsquo;t manifest tangibly in ways that affect NPCs or the world at large&mdash;nor can they be attacked&mdash;but they can interact with living PCs.</p>
<p>Before the game begins, discuss what ghosts are and what they&rsquo;re capable of. Can they walk through walls? Read emotions? Manipulate electronics? Do they even exist except as guilt-ridden hallucinations?</p>
<p>Ghosts are always less flexible and adaptable than the living, more focused on matters related to their death and unfinished business. Convert them to a Fate Core supporting NPC, choosing from the character&rsquo;s prior skills. Change their high concept to represent their ghostly state, and give them a new trouble that relates to their unfinished business.</p>
<blockquote class="example">A character who dies and returns to haunt their friends through text messages and other electronic ephemera is a <strong class="aspect">Ghost in the Machine</strong>. Another character returns as a more physical specter that&rsquo;s <strong class="aspect">Back from Hell for Re</strong><strong class="aspect">venge</strong>.</blockquote>
<p>Ghosts have the default number of stress boxes and can&rsquo;t gain more with Physique or Will, and they have a single mild consequence slot. If a ghost is taken out, it must leave the lands of the living in impending bliss or misery, based on the circumstances.</p>
<p>Ghosts are usually invisible, intangible, inaudible, and otherwise separated from physical reality. Their senses work just fine, and they can communicate freely with their still-living associates, albeit in limited ways consistent with their new high concept. They can whisper, write messages in the dust or on a computer terminal, manifest a scent survivors will associate with them, and so on.</p>
<p>Make them roll against Fair (+2) opposition when delivering complicated messages or trying to communicate in stressful situations; ghostly messages are often at risk of misinterpretation or confusion!</p>
<p>More tangible effort&mdash;louder, more physically forceful, more lasting in impact&mdash;requires crossing the gap between worlds. To do this, the ghost rolls to create an advantage with Will or another skill consistent with their high concept to create an aspect like <strong class="aspect">Manif</strong><strong class="aspect">ested</strong>.</p>
<blockquote class="example">The <strong class="aspect">Ghost in the Machine</strong> rolls Crafts to get the aspect <strong class="aspect">Repossessed Car</strong>, giving them physical control over the vehicle for as long as the aspect lasts.</blockquote>
<p>While <strong class="aspect">Manifested</strong>, the ghost can take actions to directly affect the material world at +2 to whatever opposition applies.</p>
<p>Given their frailty, ghosts make better observers and informers than active participants much of the time. Nothing is innately impossible for them, though, and they are free to attempt whatever seems dramatic and interesting. Creating haunting effects like ectoplasmic manifestations and eerie apparitions is a matter of creating an advantage.</p>
<h3>Making Sympathetic NPCs</h3>
<p>The advice in <span class="chapter-title">&ldquo;Character Creation&rdquo;</span> also applies when you&rsquo;re building NPCs. The following tools will also help you make sympathetic NPCs.</p>
<h4>We&rsquo;re A Lot Alike</h4>
<p>In fiction, it often turns out that a character isn&rsquo;t so different from the protagonist, and that they share habits, goals, or personality traits. Such similarities can cause the protagonists to identify with an antagonist and hesitate to work against them, making this a favorite technique of monologuing supervillains.</p>
<p>You can employ this technique by designing NPCs who have aspects or stunts that echo ones possessed by the PCs, albeit with sufficient tweaks that they don&rsquo;t feel like carbon copies or inversions. Any character with an aspect representing their business, hometown, school, or passionate interests has a ready-made option for this.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Marissa&rsquo;s character Kelly has a stunt that makes her an expert at recognizing and translating foreign languages. Elsa builds an NPC with a passion for creation myths and a stunt that gives him an almost inexhaustible library of books in many languages that contain such stories from around the world.</blockquote>
<h4>The Ben Franklin Effect</h4>
<p>This counterintuitive psychological principle was observed by Ben Franklin, who said, &ldquo;He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words, getting someone to do you a favor tends to make them like you more and improves the odds that they will help you again in future.</p>
<p>You can use this technique in your games by having a significant NPC request a favor from one or more of the group. It doesn&rsquo;t need to be anything huge; the example cited by Franklin in his autobiography was the temporary loan of a rare book. For your purposes, something that takes a scene or less to resolve and doesn&rsquo;t involve too much risk is ideal.</p>
<blockquote class="example">The group is about to go out into the city to scavenge food when they&rsquo;re approached by a survivor they don&rsquo;t know very well. He tells them they&rsquo;re heading into the area of the city where he used to live and he&rsquo;d be ever so grateful if they could keep an eye out for his pet cat and bring her back to him if possible. When the group is searching a mini-mart for supplies, they find the traumatized cat and spend a scene outwitting and capturing her for return to her exceedingly grateful owner. Sessions later, when the cat owner is in dire trouble (or worse, killed), the group will feel it more keenly because of the earlier favor. If you use this specific example, the result might be that the players care more for the cat than the survivor, but that could work just as well for your purposes...</blockquote>
<h4>Reciprocal Caring</h4>
<p>We come to care about people who show evidence of caring about us, and you can make this happen in your games as well. If an NPC has regular friendly chats with the PCs and asks them how they&rsquo;re doing, or gifts them a candy bar from their stash or a nip of vodka from their hip flask, it makes the NPC more real to the players and gives them a reason to care.</p>
<p>This dynamic can become creepy if taken to excess, however, or if the NPC&rsquo;s solicitousness comes across as being fake or part of a hidden agenda. Watch how your players react to the NPC&rsquo;s interest in them. If they start to suspect the NPC&rsquo;s motives or are creeped out by the attention, you have two choices.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You can dial back the NPC&rsquo;s attention to a level where the players are comfortable. Don&rsquo;t spotlight that NPC for a few scenes, and if they appear in the game anyway make sure they treat the PCs neutrally.</li>
	<li>Alternatively, you can dial <em class="Emphasis">up</em> the creepiness factor and use the NPC as a horror element in your game. It may not have been your original intention, but if it works then use it! What started out as a friendly guy just trying to pass the time socially with the group can easily turn into a devious villain with a hidden agenda.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Humanizing Victims</h4>
<p>Every horror story needs victims, and it&rsquo;s vital that the audience cares about them. The following are some techniques you can use to encourage your players to care about the victims of your vile plots.</p>
<h5>I Know Him from Somewhere</h5>
<p>Your players will care more about the victim if they aren&rsquo;t a stranger. You don&rsquo;t have to subject a major NPC to a grisly fate every week, but you can have one or more players unknowingly interact with a prospective victim some time before they meet their doom. If you&rsquo;re sneaky, you&rsquo;ll use this retroactively on an NPC that the players met in passing and ended up liking.</p>
<p>Doing this too often will strain the players&rsquo; suspension of disbelief due to the feeling of coincidences piling up, so only use this technique once or twice a scenario.</p>
<h5>Flashbacks &amp; Reconstruction</h5>
<p>You can use flashback scenes to give the players a visceral sense of what happened to a victim by having them portray the victim(s) in the moments immediately before they met their fate. This is a method typically used by shows like <i class="title">Supernatural</i> to build sympathy for the victims in the cold-open at the start of the episode.</p>
<p>When you want to employ a flashback, pause the action and say something like, &ldquo;A few hours earlier...&rdquo; then frame the scene as the last minutes of the victims&rsquo; lives. Give each player very brief details of a victim or character around them (an aspect and apex skill for each will do) and then play out the scene. Don&rsquo;t reveal too many details during this scene; use short snatches of description to build suspense and give some clues to the threat without giving it away entirely.</p>
<p>Another option is to provide clues and allow the players to reconstruct what happened for themselves.</p>
<p>When the group encounters a scene where something awful happened, come up with at least one detail about the scene per member of the group. These details can relate to what the victim was doing immediately before the incident, what happened, or the event&rsquo;s repercussions for others.</p>
<p>Give each player one detail and ask them to elaborate on it to help build a picture of the incident and its aftermath. Encourage them to add as much detail as they like about the victim&rsquo;s thought processes and the circumstances revealed by your facts. If you&rsquo;re using a communal fate pool add a point to the pool for each detail they add that will complicate things for them.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Elsa has five people in her group. They&rsquo;re going hiking in the wilderness and she plans to have them stumble across the remains of a hunter eaten by werewolves. She chooses the following details:
<ul>
	<li>Large wolf footprints paced around the perimeter of the camp</li>
	<li>The remains of a meal, barely touched, lie congealing on a plate next to the burned-down fire</li>
	<li>A rifle that is splattered with blood and smells of gunsmoke</li>
	<li>The hunter&rsquo;s satellite phone is still in his tent, and it has 18 missed messages from &ldquo;Lisa&rdquo;</li>
	<li>The hunter is now little but scattered bones, gnawed almost clean</li>
</ul>
Richard narrates how the footprints are evidence of intelligence. Whatever did this clearly paced around the perimeter of the camp as the hunter grew more and more terrified, until finally the animals attacked. Elsa gives her predators a <strong class="aspect">Highly Intelligent</strong> aspect and puts a fate point in the communal fate pool. Nick describes the horrible scene when the hunter was finally taken down and eaten, putting lots of gruesome detail into the savaging and gnawing and tearing apart. This adds to the group&rsquo;s visceral appreciation of the scene, but it doesn&rsquo;t introduce any new complications so Elsa doesn&rsquo;t add a fate point to the communal pool.</blockquote>
<p>The players may declare details that fit the facts but are incompatible with your plans&mdash;for example, Elsa&rsquo;s players might decide that the attack was carried out by intelligent wolves rather than a werewolf. If this happens you can change your story to fit the players&rsquo; interpretation of the facts or keep to your original plan&mdash;but if you do this, award each player a fate point when you dramatically reveal the truth.</p>
<h3>Using a Communal Fate Point Pool</h3>
<p>Communal fate points are a pool of additional fate points that can be used by any player, but only on behalf of another PC or an allied NPC. When a player uses a communal fate point to invoke or compel an aspect, they must explain how their character is directly involved in the action.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Rufio is a <strong class="aspect">Brash Swashbuckler</strong>. When he and Marissa&rsquo;s character Kelly are fighting a pustulous abomination in the sewer, Kelly&rsquo;s warding amulet is ripped off and starts to sink into the corrosive bile that&rsquo;s flooding the sewer channel. Nick narrates how Rufio uses the tip of his weapon&mdash;a fencing foil&mdash;to pick up the amulet and return it to Kelly with a flick of his blade. This is an action to help another character and his character is directly involved, so he can use a communal fate point to invoke his aspect.</blockquote>
<p>The communal pool resets to zero at every significant milestone and can hold as many fate points as there are players in the group&mdash;but don&rsquo;t take points away from the pool if it&rsquo;s full and some of the players can&rsquo;t make it to a session.</p>
<p>When a compel complicates matters for the group and not just a single character, give the fate point to the communal pool. Some of the other systems in this chapter also add fate points to the pool.</p>
<p>The use of communal fate points is designed to encourage the group to work together, to think about each other&rsquo;s characters, and to reduce the number of fate points gained by the group when a complication affects more than one player. Don&rsquo;t use this system if distrust and group in-fighting are core elements of the horror in your story.</p>
<p>Making communal fate points the only ones available to the players makes teamwork an absolute necessity. Decide with your group during game creation if you&rsquo;ll use communal fate points, and whether they&rsquo;ll supplement or replace each character&rsquo;s usual pool of fate points.</p>
<p>The following two systems use the communal pool to encourage players to self-compel and to declare story details that complicate matters for the group.</p>
<h5>Using a Group Aspect</h5>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using communal fate points, it&rsquo;s a good idea to give the whole group an aspect that represents its nature and provides opportunities for communal invokes and compels. This is essentially a high concept aspect that describes the whole group rather than an individual character. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Example: Rufio&rsquo;s group are <strong class="aspect">Occult Urban Expl</strong><strong class="aspect">orers</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Enhanced Self-Compels</h4>
<p>A character with visible flaws tends to be more sympathetic than one who is perfect. Giving players a small incentive to self-compel makes it more likely that they will remember to do so and therefore encourages them to take control over their own character&rsquo;s failings.</p>
<p>When a player self-compels in a way that highlights one of their character&rsquo;s flaws, they get a fate point as normal and add a fate point to the communal pool. If the communal pool is full, they instead gain a free invoke on a setting or situation aspect of their choice. If the compel causes a complication for the group rather than for the character as an individual, add two fate points to the communal pool instead.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Rufio is <strong class="aspect">Skeptical to a Fault</strong>. A sinister old man gives him some alleged &ldquo;magic words&rdquo; that will protect him from danger when he enters a haunted tomb. Rufio dismisses this out of hand because it&rsquo;s clearly a bunch of hokum. Later, when they&rsquo;re in the tomb and their weapons prove to be useless against the eldritch threat bearing down on them, Rufio decides to use the spell just in case it works after all. Nick suggests that Rufio didn&rsquo;t try to remember it properly and ends up garbling the words. Instead of protecting the group from the wight, the spell makes it angry! This is a complication for the whole group, so the compel adds two fate points to the communal pool.</blockquote>
<h4>Encouraging Players to Declare Story Details</h4>
<p>You can help players engage with their own characters and the NPCs they encounter by encouraging them to declare story details that humanize the character for everyone. Once per scene, when a player declares an appropriate story detail, they add a fate point to the communal pool instead of paying a fate point.</p>
<p>To get this benefit, the story detail that they add must be inconvenient or at least neutral rather than helpful in the current circumstances, and must directly pertain to a character or their activities.</p>
<blockquote class="example">The group is investigating the death of a <strong class="aspect">Lonely Insurance Executive</strong> who was found next to his parked car with severe acid burns all over him. Bruce says, &ldquo;He was sitting in his car after work looking at a dating app on his phone. He&rsquo;d decided earlier that day that he wasn&rsquo;t going to find anyone unless he started looking more actively.&rdquo; Because this story detail isn&rsquo;t immediately useful but helps to humanize the victim, Bruce adds a fate point to the communal pool.</blockquote>
<h3>Exploring Strange and Dangerous Desires</h3>
<p>Helping the players empathize with their characters&rsquo; conflicted desires can build their investment in the game. Desire is wonderful and terrible. It pushes and pulls us in directions we never expected to go, in ways we may find unimaginable until we&rsquo;re actually doing them. Desire isn&rsquo;t just about sex&mdash;it&rsquo;s about all the things we do for and because of our objects of desire, the things we give up for their sake, and the ways we change our whole lives for them. Sometimes these changes are marvelous, often they&rsquo;ve got a funny side, and sometimes they&rsquo;re downright horrific. This tool will help you represent that last kind of desire in your game, focusing on strange desires, on the clash of desire-driven wants with other values, and on the question of what&rsquo;s really monstrous when all&rsquo;s said and done.</p>
<p>Even if you focus on desire, your game need not make a turn for the erotic. Our goal is to emphasize the <em class="Emphasis">sensations</em> of desire&mdash;wanting what someone feels they shouldn&rsquo;t want, the hardships (and rewards) of pursuing the subject of ambiguous desire, the feelings of satisfaction and regret at a desire fulfilled, and so on. This book doesn&rsquo;t have any advice on playing out actual sexual acts; you&rsquo;re on your own for that.</p>
<p>The key to <em class="Emphasis">horror</em> from desire is the conflict between desire and repulsion for the same object. If you only wanted people of a sort you typically found attractive and had reason to believe wouldn&rsquo;t be harmful for you, there&rsquo;d be little room for horror. If you only felt fear, anger, and repulsion toward a person, then your horror would have little room for desire. When both combine, any conviction in sensible rules of desire fall apart and things seem terribly, horribly, wonderfully possible.</p>
<h4>Before the Game</h4>
<p>During game creation, discuss whether the group wants the sensual horror of desire to be a notable factor in the game. Making it so has a significant impact on the feel of the game&mdash;characters will spend more time agonizing over their conflicted desires and their mental and emotional state than some groups are comfortable with. It&rsquo;s the difference between <i class="title">Day of the Dead</i> and <i class="title">Life After Beth</i> or <i class="title">Warm B</i><i class="title">odies</i>.</p>
<h4>During the Game: Intensity Aspects</h4>
<p>A character who forms a bond of intense emotional engagement with someone or something else in the game can change one of their character aspects at a minor milestone to an <strong class="terminology">intensity aspect</strong> like <strong class="aspect">Captivated by Her Mysterious Charms</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Always Thinking of What It Hints At</strong>, or <strong class="aspect">Repelled by Him, But Unable to Leave Him</strong> that represents their desire.</p>
<p>Characters can also gain intensity aspects due to accepting an extreme consequence or when they&rsquo;re taken out in an appropriate conflict.</p>
<p>Unlike normal aspects, intensity aspects have a numerical rating to reflect the magnitude and direction of the engagement. A persistent but controllable attraction starts at +1, up to +3 for all-consuming desire that&rsquo;s leading the character to neglect the rest of their life for the sake of the attraction. Persistent but controllable repulsion starts at -1, down to -3 for all-consuming hatred and fear. One of the keys to the horror of desire is that engagement can change its nature as well as its intensity in an instant.</p>
<p>The key to good intensity aspects is ambiguity. Is it a thing the character is proud of, ashamed of, or both at once? Does it suggest both promise and peril? Does it sound like the setup for all kinds of trouble? Then it&rsquo;s a good intensity aspect.</p>
<p>The bonus or penalty comes into play as the character acts. When the intensity rating is positive, the character gets a bonus when they&rsquo;re trying to help the object of fascination and increased opposition when acting against the object&rsquo;s interests. When the rating is negative, the character gets a bonus to hinder the object and faces increased opposition if they try to help them.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If a character takes an action that works with their intensity aspect, they can use the aspect&rsquo;s absolute intensity rating instead of a skill <em class="Emphasis">or</em> use a skill at +1.</li>
	<li>If a character takes an action that works against their intensity aspect, they face minimum opposition of the aspect&rsquo;s absolute intensity rating. If the opposition was already higher than this, it gets +1.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="example">Someone with Average (+1) Shoot trying to gun down a target for whom they have a -3 intensity aspect would roll at Good (+3) because they are attacking the object of their loathing. Someone with Average (+1) Athletics trying to dodge a punch from someone with a +3 intensity aspect towards them would roll at Good (+3) because their opponent is working against their own desire.</blockquote>
<h5>Changing Intensity Aspects</h5>
<p>Characters can voluntarily move the rating of an intensity aspect up or down a level instead of swapping a skill at a milestone. If they reduce an intensity aspect to 0 they can immediately swap it out for another aspect at the same time. This is the only way to get rid of an intensity aspect.</p>
<p>Once per scenario, the character&rsquo;s object of desire may also try to change the intensity aspect&rsquo;s rating by initiating a contest. The object of desire plays on the character&rsquo;s various hopes and fears, whether revealed naturally without extra mechanical effort or by creating advantages to expose more of the character&rsquo;s vulnerabilities. The character may make appeals of their own, or engage in defensive efforts to reinforce their sense of themselves and the relationship. If the object of desire wins, it can choose one of two options:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Raise or lower the rating by a level.</li>
	<li>Invert the rating, turning attraction into repulsion or vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="example-start">Addison, once a perfectly normal database manager for a regional phone company, has been obsessed with the thing calling itself Doctor Finale for a year now. A minor trouble ticket revealed strange things, and inquiry escalated into curiosity, then repelled fascination. Addison has the aspect <strong class="aspect">Everything Is About Doctor Finale, Sooner or Later</strong> at -2. Doctor Finale likes the attention but not the trouble-making, and in the wake of Addison reaching a significant milestone, makes its move.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="example-end">This is the second time the two have met face-to-face. Doctor Finale lures Addison to a cafeteria in the persona of a colleague with stories about similar monsters elsewhere. As they share lunch, Doctor Finale slides smoothly from flattery to the temptation of full knowledge of entities like itself. Addison gradually realizes what&rsquo;s sitting across the table, but all efforts to disengage somehow fail. Doctor Finale wins the contest, and flips the rating&rsquo;s direction. Now Addison has the aspect at +2.</blockquote>
<h3>Posing Moral Dilemmas</h3>
<p>A moral dilemma means making a difficult choice between two or more alternatives, each of which is similarly undesirable. We use <em class="Emphasis">dilemma</em> here in its popular sense, rather than its strict meaning of a moral conundrum with explicitly two alternatives.</p>
<p>Moral dilemmas are a staple of horror fiction and you can use them to great effect in your games. However, they require careful handling to ensure that your players experience them as dramatic and enjoyable scenes rather than artificially constrained situations that take away their agency.</p>
<h4>Everyday Moral Dilemmas</h4>
<p>Not all dilemmas are matters of life or death. Everyday dilemmas are a great way of creating drama through internal conflict as the characters wrestle with what to do. Several of the tools in this book rely on this technique, for example the rules for rationing and starvation in <span class="chapter-title">The High Cost of Living</span>.</p>
<p>You can also use aspects that are in tension with each other to spotlight these sorts of dilemmas. If the character&rsquo;s choice ultimately makes things more difficult for them, this is a compel.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="inline-header">Principle vs. Need: If a character believes that a certain behavior is wrong but they need something they can obtain by engaging in that behavior, will they stick to their principles or will they do it, just this once?</p>
<blockquote class="example">A character who&rsquo;s <strong class="aspect">Always Faithful</strong> but has a <strong class="aspect">Big Debt to Pay</strong> is offered a waiver of their debt in exchange for a &ldquo;harmless secret&rdquo; about another member of the group.</blockquote>
<p class="inline-header">Deferred Gratification vs. Instant Gratification: When a character has an opportunity to get what they want right now but with a cost of some kind, or must otherwise wait until much later, what will they choose?</p>
<blockquote class="example">A character sees a <strong class="aspect">Hated Enemy</strong> through her rifle scope and has a brief window to shoot before they disappear to safety...but if she fires it will make a loud noise and draw the <strong class="aspect">Ravenous </strong><strong class="aspect">Horde</strong>.</blockquote>
<p class="inline-header">Divided Loyalties: If a character is loyal to two different characters, but those characters are in a conflict with each other, what do they do?</p>
<blockquote class="example">A character&rsquo;s <strong class="aspect">Reliable Friend</strong> wants to go out into the wilderness to look for more survivors so they can rescue as many people as possible while their <strong class="aspect">Pragmatic Strategist</strong> lover wants to consolidate their resources and secure their position. When put in the middle of these two perspectives, how do they resolve the argument and prevent either character from being upset with them?</blockquote>
<h4>Climactic Dilemmas</h4>
<p>When a story is in its final act, the characters sometimes face a terrible dilemma with high stakes and no ideal or even satisfactory options in sight. In this case, the best they can usually do is choose the least of the available evils.</p>
<p>The following system walks you through how to frame a scene as a climactic dilemma so that your players will agonize over their choices rather than begrudge their lack of options.</p>
<p>First, some ground rules:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It&rsquo;s called a climactic dilemma for a reason: A dilemma like this is a moment of great narrative significance, when the outcome of an entire scenario hangs in the balance. Only use this technique once a scenario or you&rsquo;ll burn your players out.</li>
	<li>Options, not outcomes: When you frame a climactic dilemma, give the group a limited range of options and give them some idea of the ramifications of each. The outcomes are not yet determined, though, and will change depending on how the resolution scene plays out.</li>
	<li>There&rsquo;s always another way: Your PCs can ignore the options in front of them and try to chart their own course through the dilemma. This path is extremely difficult and can exact a terrible price on the PCs, but the option is there.</li>
	<li>Dilemmas are rewarding: Because framing a scene as a dilemma constrains the players&rsquo; options unless they fight terrible odds to go their own way, this is a form of compel. Give each player involved in the scene a fate point when you initiate the resolution of a climactic dilemma.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Planning and Presentation</h5>
<p>Dilemmas work best if the players have a chance to anticipate&mdash;or dread&mdash;them, especially if they can discuss and agonize over their limited options well before they act.</p>
<p>You will eventually explicitly state the dilemma to your players and then pressure them to act on a decision before something horrible happens because of their inaction. By the time you trigger this climactic scene, they should already be aware of the looming dilemma and the options available to them.</p>
<p>Sometimes an effective dilemma develops naturally from the PCs&rsquo; aspects, interactions, and behavior during the game. If a situation arises where the players are already agonizing over what course to take out of several conflicting options, that&rsquo;s an ideal opportunity for you to trigger a climactic scene with the choices they&rsquo;ve already identified.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you might think up a really dramatic dilemma and use it to inspire an entire scenario. In this case, you can gradually introduce the options available to the PCs as the scenario unfolds so that the dilemma feels natural to the players when you trigger the resolution scene.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Elsa comes up with a dilemma that she plans her next scenario around. A malevolent spirit is possessing a young firefighter and using them as a vessel to commit unspeakable acts of evil. Elsa decides there are two equally unpalatable ways the group can deal with the spirit. They can exorcise the spirit at risk to the firefighter, temporarily resolving the problem of the possessed victim&rsquo;s evil acts, but the spirit will be able to cross back over and possess another host next Hallowe&rsquo;en. Alternatively, they can use a magical ritual to permanently bind the spirit into the firefighter&rsquo;s body. This will also make the firefighter immortal, so the PCs can lock them in chains and bury them deep underground to keep the spirit out of the mortal world forever. Unfortunately, trapped in their mind with only the evil spirit for company, the firefighter will suffer an eternity of torment...but the spirit won&rsquo;t trouble the mortal world ever again.</blockquote>
<h5>Choosing Not to Act</h5>
<p>The players always have the option of doing nothing, but when you&rsquo;re planning your dilemma make sure that the consequences of inaction are as bad&mdash;or worse&mdash;than the other available choices.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Elsa decides that if the group takes no action against the spirit possessing the firefighter, it will lock the doors during a matinee performance at a major local theatre and then burn the place to the ground, incinerating everyone inside. </blockquote>
<h5>Making Things More Complicated</h5>
<p>You can begin with a simple dilemma and then introduce complications to make it a more difficult decision for the PCs. As a simple example, if they must choose between saving one person or three, they&rsquo;ll find the decision much harder to make if the choice is between one young child and three adults. But there&rsquo;s no need to stop there; what if the child is possessed by a vicious ghost and the adults are police officers trying to arrest her?</p>
<p>The best complications are ones that align with aspects belonging to the PCs or to your game, because you already know that these are important to the group. The Holy Grail of dilemmas is one with complications relevant to two or more conflicting aspects, as this will encourage a great deal of soul searching and debate among the PCs.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Elsa looks at the PCs&rsquo; aspects and sees that Marissa&rsquo;s character Kelly has the aspect <strong class="aspect">No Woman Left Behind</strong>. Elsa decides that the firefighter will be a woman so Kelly is more likely to argue for saving her instead of trapping the spirit. Meanwhile, Sarah&rsquo;s character has the aspect <strong class="aspect">A Stitch in Time Saves Nine</strong>, meaning that she&rsquo;s more likely to argue for causing a known amount of suffering to one person in order to prevent an unknowable amount of suffering to others in the future on the spirit&rsquo;s return.</blockquote>
<p>If a PC ends up strongly conflicting with others in the group due to the way one of their aspects pertains to a moral dilemma, give them a fate point as if this were a self-compel.</p>
<h5>Resolution</h5>
<p>Time pressure is essential to making a dilemma play out with the drama it deserves, so the first part of triggering a resolution scene is to show the players why they need to act in the imminent future.</p>
<blockquote class="example">During a scene, Elsa&rsquo;s players investigate the possessed firefighter and observe her reconnoitering the theatre and sabotaging one of the fire exit doors, allowing them to deduce the spirit&rsquo;s plan. The players know they must make a decision on what to do and put their plan in motion soon if they are to prevent a tragedy.</blockquote>
<p class="inline-header">Declaration: Next, formally frame the situation as a dilemma so the players know what they&rsquo;re up against. Hand everyone a fate point and say something like:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a dilemma on your hands. If you don&rsquo;t act now, [bad result of inaction] will happen. But will you [option 1], in which case [a rough idea of the consequences] or will you [option 2], in which case [a rough idea of the consequences]?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote class="example">Elsa says, &ldquo;You have a dilemma on your hands. If you don&rsquo;t act now, hundreds of people could be burned alive. But will you hunt down the firefighter and perform a dangerous exorcism, at best freeing the spirit to return next Hallowe&rsquo;en, or will you use the spell you discovered in the Codex Infernus to trap the spirit forever in the body of the firefighter, condemning her to a personal hell but preventing the spirit from harming anyone else?&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>Next the group discusses the situation and decides how to proceed, choosing between the options presented in the dilemma or one of their own devising. If the characters can&rsquo;t come to a unanimous decision that&rsquo;s fine&mdash;anyone who voted against the choice made can refuse to get involved or actively oppose the other characters during the following scene.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Climax: Whatever option the players choose sets the stakes of the climactic scene, which you then resolve as a conflict, challenge, or contest&mdash;whichever fits the situation best.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Elsa&rsquo;s group discusses the dilemma extensively and ultimately comes down to a split decision to imprison the spirit in the firefighter&rsquo;s body. Three of them will proceed on this basis while the other two plan to get in their way and exorcise the spirit instead. When Marissa and Phil act later to defy the group, they each get a fate point. Because there&rsquo;s a lot going on, Elsa decides to run the climactic scene as a conflict between the players and the possessed firefighter. If the three who want to trap the spirit win, they get to proceed with their plan. If the firefighter wins, then the spirit gets to proceed with its attack (or escape). If the two who want to try to exorcise the spirit win&mdash;against all the odds&mdash;they can save the firefighter and free the spirit.</blockquote>
<p class="inline-header">Going Their Own Way: If the group chooses an option not presented in the dilemma, they must contend with opposition that&rsquo;s three or four points higher. In addition, the results of being taken out will be much more severe&mdash;at minimum players should expect to receive an extreme consequence if they are taken out.</p>
<blockquote class="example">If Elsa&rsquo;s group had decided to take their own option of using untested magic to remove the spirit from the firefighter&rsquo;s body and immediately trap it in a doll, they would have gone into the climactic scene facing Legendary (+8) rather than Superb (+5) opposition and knowing that if they were taken out they would suffer at least an extreme consequence. It&rsquo;s a happier ending, but a lot more difficult to achieve.</blockquote>
<p class="inline-header">Changes of Heart: If the group, or anyone in it, changes their mind and decides to work towards a different option in the climactic scene, that&rsquo;s fine&mdash;in fact, it&rsquo;s a great source of drama. If they switch to work on an option not declared in the dilemma, they face increased opposition and greater risk as previously described in <span class="chapter-title">&ldquo;Going Their Own Way&rdquo;</span>.</p>
<h3>Conclusion: Be Adaptable and, if It Works, Keep Doing It</h3>
<p>The tools and advice we&rsquo;ve provided in this chapter will help you present compelling NPCs and situations to the players that will help them buy into the game and invest in its horror themes. The rest of this book provides specific advice related to various types and themes of horror, but we have one last piece of general advice.</p>
<p>Rather than relying on preconceived notions of what will make your players invest in your horror game, be prepared to adapt according to their reactions.</p>
<p>Look for patterns in how they respond and, once you&rsquo;ve found something that works, do more of that thing. Be careful not to wear it out, though; familiarity really does breed contempt. For example, if the group starts to become blas&eacute; about NPCs with too many finger joints and shadows that move all by themselves, find something else to scare them with.</p>

<p>Fate Core provides a system for mental conflicts and the potentially lasting consequences that can result from them. The tools we provide here are designed to supplement the standard mental conflict rules in handling the long-term mental toll of horror on the characters.</p>
<h2>Media Inspiration</h2>
<p>The following books, movies, and TV shows are useful sources of inspiration when considering the mental toll of horror:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i class="title">The Orphanage</i> is an excellent movie that speaks to the extremes to which grief can drive people.</li>

	<li><i class="title">Child of Fire</i> features creatures that provoke a visceral reaction largely outside of normal horror tropes.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Scream</i>, <i class="title">A Nightmare on Elm Street</i>, and <i class="title">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</i> are the classics of &rsquo;80s slasher flicks, and capture the essence of splatter horror.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tools of the Trade</h2>
<p>Representing mental health issues at the table is something you must handle sensitively and respectfully. The possibility of causing distress to a player by mistreating the subject is very real, and so is the risk of reinforcing prejudice against&mdash;and misunderstanding of&mdash;people with mental health issues.</p>
<p>The issues of player consent and safety we discussed earlier are of paramount importance when you&rsquo;re going to explore the subject of mental health. So, before discussing specific rules, let&rsquo;s briefly review the general tools that you have at your disposal as a GM to make psychological trauma a viable&mdash;and non-harmful&mdash;character arc at the game table.</p>
<p><strong class="terminology">Metagaming</strong> is the practice of considering the game as a whole&mdash;including rule books, character sheets, and other materials&mdash;rather than relying entirely on in-character experiences. While often derided for &ldquo;ruining&rdquo; a game, metagaming is an excellent tool for discussing choices prior to their occurrence.</p>
<p><strong class="terminology">Steering </strong>is the use of the metagame materials and out-of-character discussion to make in-character choices. Your group needs to be on the same page when it comes to the use of psychological trauma in plot and story, and the best way to do this is with all eyes open following a discussion of the subject.</p>
<p>In addition to using discussion to make plot points about mental illness acceptable, use of X-Cards, Script Change, and <strong class="terminology">Open Door Policies</strong> (players can leave the table at any time for no reason, to protect their boundaries) can help keep the room feeling safe. Just because you&rsquo;ve discussed something prior to it happening, doesn&rsquo;t mean that everyone will be okay in the moment that it happens. A player who was just fine with the idea of roleplaying a mental breakdown might not be when it comes time to do so, or someone else at the game table may find to their surprise that it&rsquo;s too much for them to watch.</p>
<p>All these tools make it possible to tell stories involving mental illness and psychological trauma safely and respectfully.</p>
<h2>Wounds Lead to Scars</h2>
<p>Horror fiction is powered by the things we fear. Commonly, we fear the things that can happen&mdash;or be done&mdash;to us, or to our friends and families. We can experience a trauma, and thus acquire mental health issues that we didn&rsquo;t have before. As explored in <span class="chapter-title">&ldquo;Body Horror&rdquo;</span>, we can lose a limb, sight, or hearing in a horrifying way, and mental consequences can result. There may also be mental consequences for seeing something awful, as described in <span class="chapter-title">&ldquo;Visceral Horror&rdquo;</span>.</p>
<p>Whatever happens to a character, there can be psychological repercussions if what happened was traumatic.</p>
<p>Such repercussions are real. Unlike a system with a well of sanity points which can run out and make a character unplayable, we encourage you and your players to recognize and engage with psychological trauma, and to see through the consequences of a character&rsquo;s actions or experiences. Having mental consequences doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re out of the game.</p>
<p>The trick is, when we play out the kinds of horror which require us to pursue very real fears, we must treat the people in real life who <em class="Emphasis">experience</em> these things with civility and kindness. This section addresses some ways you can do that without harming players&mdash;or even observers&mdash;of your game.</p>
<p>Before we get started, we want to state up front two hard rules for portraying characters with psychological problems in any Fate horror game:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mental illness does not make people act like cartoonish caricatures. Players must keep their characters consistent with their aspects and pre-existing beliefs rather than using their psychological issues as an excuse to act without a moral compass or to do &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; things.</li>
	<li>People with psychological problems are not punchlines. Characters may well find humor in their situation, but it&rsquo;s important that your group only ever laughs <em class="Emphasis">with</em> characters rather than <em class="Emphasis">at</em> them in respect to their mental health.</li>
</ul>
<h5>What About Existing Mental Illnesses?</h5>
<p>The <i class="title">Fate Accessibility Toolkit</i> is a handbook for playing disabled characters and running games with disabled characters in them. It covers a variety of disabilities, including actual psychological disorders and mental illnesses, and how they might be portrayed within a game.</p>
<h5>Dealing with Grief</h5>
<p>Bereavement is a particularly potent source of mental harm. Loss is something we must all deal with in our real lives, and in a horror game PCs and NPCs are likely to die on a regular basis. How characters respond to the loss of a close friend, mentor, or collaborator is a worthwhile place to explore psychological trauma. If you&rsquo;ve ever experienced the death of a family member or friend, you probably remember what it felt like, but there are many ways to grieve.</p>
<p>Characters who live with addictions might indulge in those habits more than they regularly do as a reaction to a death. Others may go totally numb, protecting themselves from their actual feelings by pretending that nothing is wrong&mdash;right up until it goes very wrong. Still others react with anger.</p>
<p>Grief is an emotional and physical response to death. Some people feel physically ill upon hearing that they&rsquo;ve lost someone&mdash;and it&rsquo;s not a psychosomatic response. Others can&rsquo;t stop crying, no matter how hard they try.</p>
<p>Grief can be about more than death, as well. Loss of a friendship, a lost pet, or any other kind of traumatic or sudden loss, whether it&rsquo;s a death or the end of a career, can trigger grief responses from characters.</p>
<h2>Trauma Aspects</h2>
<p>For the purposes of this section, a trauma is a single, definable event or series of closely related events that creates overwhelming distress and exceeds a character&rsquo;s ability to cope normally.</p>
<p>A <strong class="terminology">trauma aspect</strong> is any aspect that&rsquo;s intended to represent a significant, long-lasting effect of trauma on a character&rsquo;s mental wellbeing. This will usually be a moderate, severe, or extreme consequence or an aspect gained while a <strong class="terminology">coping condition</strong> is checked. A player can choose to treat a situation aspect as a trauma aspect if they understand this will make it last indefinitely; characters never really heal from traumas so much as they find ways to cope with them.</p>
<p>Whenever a character takes a trauma aspect, identify potential triggers and responses associated with the aspect. Together, these form a guide as to how the character expresses their reaction to the trauma in everyday life.</p>
<blockquote class="example">If a character was in a horrific car accident, they may have an anxiety attack every time they try to drive a car on the highway, or in the rain. If they were trapped inside a house with a serial killer trying to break in, they may be afraid of being alone, or they might still get a pang of fear in their gut when they walk past a window with the curtains closed. Or maybe they&rsquo;re afraid of the sound of knocking on the door. </blockquote>
<p>Players, take the time to research genuine mental illnesses when coming up with trauma aspects, as this will help you to pick triggers and responses that really go together instead of building a genre clich&eacute;. It&rsquo;s possible that you&rsquo;ll discover what you were looking for wasn&rsquo;t what you expected.</p>
<p>Rather than using a clinical name like <strong class="aspect">Acute Stress Disorder</strong>, use an evocative name that guides how the aspect affects the character&mdash;mental illness doesn&rsquo;t look the same for any one person all the time.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Richard&rsquo;s character, Tanvir, was in a car crash that killed his husband. His husband&rsquo;s ghost has been haunting Tanvir in mirrors and windows ever since. Richard researches post-traumatic stress disorder and decides it would be the appropriate basis of a trauma aspect, so he chooses <strong class="aspect">Legacy of Shattered </strong><strong class="aspect">Glass</strong>.</blockquote>
<h3>Using Trauma Aspects in Play</h3>
<p>You can invoke or compel trauma aspects when appropriate&mdash;usually when one of the triggering conditions you identified when creating the aspect occurs&mdash;to complicate a character&rsquo;s life in a way consistent with their psychological state.</p>
<p>One technique is to compel a trauma aspect to incite a flashback, in which the player re-enacts the traumatizing scene from their character&rsquo;s past. Used sparingly&mdash;once a session at most&mdash;this is an excellent way to instill a scene with drama and character development.</p>
<blockquote class="example">When the ghost punches a mirror to get Tanvir&rsquo;s attention, the GM asks Richard to play out a fraction of that car crash in a flashback spotlight scene. </blockquote>
<p>A character can be compelled in other ways as they fail to cope with their trauma, meaning they experience nightmares, experience a panic attack, or freeze in place. They might instead use a maladaptive coping mechanism like ritualized behavior, avoidance, or hypervigilance. See <span class="chapter-title">&ldquo;Coping Conditions&rdquo;</span> for a system that builds on the idea of maladaptive coping.</p>
<p>When a character marks a box of mental or physical stress, that&rsquo;s a good time to offer a compel on one of their trauma aspects as the strain of the situation causes the symptom to take effect. Most importantly, the player and GM should agree on what triggers the symptom or condition.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Tanvir has a <strong class="aspect">Gun-Shy</strong> condition that he marked off during a desperate gunfight. Later, when he&rsquo;s in a standoff with a gun-toting cultist and has to mark his second physical stress box, Elsa uses that as justification for a compel on <strong class="aspect">Gun-Shy</strong> to make him freeze for a moment and let the cultist move unopposed to a tactically advantageous position.</blockquote>
<p>Trauma aspects last until the character takes the time to treat them through professional therapy or heart-to-heart conversation with another character. Each game will function differently in how difficult it is to treat trauma aspects, but the idea is to highlight the process of healing and treating mental illnesses. Players heal their characters&rsquo; physical wounds by seeing a medic; why wouldn&rsquo;t characters also see therapists or psychiatrists?</p>
<p>Once a trauma aspect has completely healed, this means that the character has learned to use healthy coping mechanisms to deal with their psychological discomfort, which never entirely goes away. Healthy coping mechanisms aren&rsquo;t an aspect to be invoked or compelled, but part of how the character acts and behaves.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Tanvir eventually lays the ghost of his husband to rest; the literal haunting ends, though he continues to be haunted by the accident. Eventually, after regular visits to a therapist, he learns to cope with his remaining symptoms of PTSD using mindfulness, exercising regularly, and investing more deeply in his other relationships.</blockquote>
<h2>Coping Conditions</h2>
<p>This system uses <strong class="terminology">conditions</strong> from <i class="title">Dresden Files Accelerated</i>, page 116, to represent <strong class="terminology">coping conditions</strong>&mdash;maladaptive coping mechanisms that enable characters to keep functioning in the face of a horrible, hostile world, but which ultimately make life more difficult for the character.</p>
<ul>
	<li>When a character takes physical or mental stress, their player can check a coping condition to absorb stress <em class="Emphasis">in addition</em> to a single stress box and any number of consequences.</li>
	<li>A fleeting coping condition can absorb two shifts of stress, a sticky one can absorb four shifts of stress, and a lasting one can absorb six shifts of stress.</li>
	<li>You can also cause PCs to check a coping condition due to the consequences of a compel or an in-game experience that doesn&rsquo;t inflict stress, such as encountering an eldritch tome.</li>
	<li>A coping condition is defined the first time it&rsquo;s checked, not written on the character sheet in advance.</li>
	<li>While a coping condition is checked, the character has a trauma aspect of the same name. If an opponent caused the condition to be checked, they get a free invoke on the related trauma aspect as normal.</li>
	<li>Checking a coping condition means that the character begins engaging in the maladaptive coping behavior described by the condition, and will do so until they take whatever steps are necessary to clear out the condition. As the character has an aspect of the same name, they can be the subject of appropriate invokes and compels.</li>
	<li>Each character can have only one of each kind of coping condition&mdash;fleeting, sticky, and lasting&mdash;on their character sheet.</li>
	<li>Coping conditions aren&rsquo;t fixed to a limited list; any character can take one of the example conditions given here or a new one created by your group.</li>
	<li>If a character has an unchecked coping condition at a minor milestone, their player can delete the condition from their character sheet instead of changing one of their aspects.</li>
	<li>If a character already has a coping condition defined and needs to check a more severe one, they can &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; their current coping condition, moving it to the higher condition slot and freeing its existing slot for immediate use. They can only do this if they don&rsquo;t currently have a condition defined in the higher slot.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="example">Elsa is playing a Mythos Scholar and marks a sticky <strong class="condition">Flashbacks</strong> coping condition on encountering an evil book. She experiences flashbacks to the horrors within the text, hideous images flashing across her mind every time she tries to recall the book&rsquo;s content. Later, when exposure makes Elsa&rsquo;s flashbacks worsen, she upgrades it to a lasting condition as she suffers repeated nightmares featuring the content she&rsquo;s read. This frees up her sticky coping condition slot for later use.</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Fleeting coping conditions remain checked for a scene but are cleared out immediately when the scene ends or the character escapes from it.</li>
	<li>Sticky coping conditions remain checked until the character recuperates naturally. The maladaptive coping behavior recurs when triggered by stressful situations or affects the character continually until they have a chance to find some peace with a good night&rsquo;s sleep, a stiff drink, a convivial meal, meditation, or some other calming and centering activity.</li>
	<li>Lasting coping conditions remain checked until the character seeks help. The maladaptive coping behavior recurs regularly and the character must receive counseling and/or medication to clear the condition, needing someone to overcome at least Great (+4) opposition.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example Coping Conditions</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Hypervigilance: Characters with this condition might be highly sensitive to touch, or have an overactive startle reflex, increased scanning for threats, and heightened awareness of surroundings. A fleeting version of this condition fades when the immediate danger is past, while a sticky hypervigilance condition can be resolved with rest and the establishment of trust. A lasting hypervigilance condition may never be resolved without significant story developments.</li>
	<li>Obsessive Ritual (sticky or lasting only): The character copes with their psychological distress and lack of control through specific rituals. Some rituals are checking mechanisms (checking locks, turning faucets on and off) while others relate to distress about contamination (fear of germs, excessive washing of hands), hoarding, rumination, or intrusive thoughts. Sticky conditions are treated by the resolution of the concern (for example, some kind of workaround for the stemming issue like carrying hand sanitizer or having a security system) while lasting ones can be permanent without significant psychological assistance.</li>
	<li> Avoidance: The character cannot engage with the object of their trauma. For example, Elsa&rsquo;s character steps on a rattlesnake. The snake doesn&rsquo;t bite her, but the experience of finding her foot right next to a rattling snake, ready to strike and able to poison her, sticks. Whenever she sees a picture of a snake, her heart speeds up and she looks away. When she finds out there are plastic snakes at the toy store, she reroutes herself to avoid it. Avoidance can look like sticking fingers in ears to not hear a topic of discussion, closing eyes, taking alternate routes, or shouting over someone so you cannot hear them.</li>
	<li>Inappropriate Emotion: The character&rsquo;s emotional responses to sources of stress are mixed up. For example, instead of becoming scared in a nerve-wracking situation your character becomes angry and prone to lashing out at her allies because anger is more controllable than fear. A fleeting version of this condition fades when the stimulus is past, while a sticky version needs to be resolved after resting and having a chance to process complex emotional responses. A lasting version requires conversation, soul-searching, and therapeutic assistance to overcome.</li>
</ul>
<h2>On Othering Mental Illness</h2>
<p>The Collins English Dictionary defines othering as &ldquo;feeling or making others feel disowned and alienated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When creating stories involving mental illness, it&rsquo;s important to make sure not to other those mental illnesses. Othering in fiction is the act of creating characters whom readers and consumers of media cannot identify with because they are different, and using that difference to make the audience fear them. An example of this is Renfield from <i class="title">Dracula</i>. Renfield does the bidding of a vicious creature, he wears the trappings of insanity (a straitjacket), and he eats flies and other insects. All these things are the imagery used to paint Renfield as &ldquo;crazy&rdquo;&mdash;and thus supposedly incomprehensible to us. Mental illness is being used in this context to make Renfield scary or creepy, rather than him being perfectly sane and still working for Dracula (which to me, reader, is even scarier).</p>
<p>The practice of othering creates a space between a person who is different and &ldquo;normal&rdquo; people, and capitalizes on that space to make the other look more terrifying. When you create characters with mental illnesses, please don&rsquo;t cast them only as a villain or tragic figure. Plenty of people with mental illnesses come out of normal and stable settings, and while we don&rsquo;t want to make it look like mental illness isn&rsquo;t a problem, we need to acknowledge that a mental illness, by itself, is not a reason to simply decide someone is evil or in some other way unfit for social interaction.</p>
<p>Especially in America, where the distinction between a perpetrator of gun violence and a &ldquo;crazy person&rdquo; must be re-examined every time there is a tragedy, we must not conflate mental illness with violent acts. We must remember that people with logic and purpose might still have a mental illness, and that people who commit violent acts may not have one at all. Oversimplifying these matters hurts everyone, not just those with the illnesses in question.</p>
<p>Horror fiction has a particularly bad track record for othering people for their nature, mental or physical issues, or behavior as a lazy way of indicating that they&rsquo;re the villain or to make it acceptable that they become victims.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to use themes of The Other in your horror games without punching down at people who are different from the mainstream, where The Other represents the forces of totalitarianism, alien threats, or a liberating or a transformative force which is ultimately embraced by the characters.</p>
<h2>The Horror of Viscera and Gore</h2>
<p>A common source of emotional and mental distress for characters in horror fiction is exposure to bodily harm or its gory aftermath. You can use these as a seasoning in your game to induce instinctual reactions of repulsion and revulsion in both a player and their character. This shared reaction can help the player identify with their character&rsquo;s situation and heighten other aspects of horror&mdash;for example, a sense of helplessness.</p>
<p>In this section, we provide tools and advice for using visceral and splatter horror in your games as a source of psychological trauma for the characters. Like any seasoning, use visceral horror sparingly&mdash;repeated use quickly numbs its impact.</p>
<h5>Lovecraftian Horror</h5>
<p>While this section is aimed squarely at emulating gore and splatter horror, its systems also work well for representing the disturbing and unsettling nature of encounters with the eldritch and uncanny which are the hallmarks of Lovecraftian horror. Rather than gore, encounters are with mind-boggling architecture and Things That Should Not Be.</p>
<h3>The Narrative Uses of Viscera</h3>
<p>When describing viscera, open and close your description with senses other than sight to heighten the sense of wrongness and discomfort. Open with the taste of rot in the air, or the smell of a pustulous blight. End with the squishing sound of something moving or settling, or the feel of something unexpectedly wet&mdash;or dry&mdash;under a character&rsquo;s foot or hand.</p>
<p>Viscera serves a practical purpose as well, by providing evidence of something off-screen. This allows you to retain mystery by keeping a threat out of view while influencing the current action with its aftermath. Gory remnants of an attack provide clues about how a monster works, such as how it kills its victims or whether it behaves in certain ways during or after an attack. Such remnants can also build tension by intimating a future threat, demonstrating the power of something that must be confronted&mdash;or escaped&mdash;soon, or revealing some of its capabilities.</p>
<p>Splatter horror overturns the normal limitations of viscera by turning the gore up to eleven. Depictions of violence are frequent, extreme, and fast-paced, resulting in exaggerated injury and suffering. When you&rsquo;re running a splatter horror game, use the same advice and mechanics, but delay any viscera-related compels until after the dust settles and events have had a chance to sink in.</p>
<h3>Visceral Aspect Compels</h3>
<p>Viscera is normally the basis for compels as soon as the characters encounter it. As their instincts override their higher reasoning and they make bad decisions as a result, their players temporarily lose their narrative control as well. Usually you&rsquo;ll compel a situation or monster aspect representing the gore itself, but in some subgenres tying the compel back to a character aspect may be more impactful.</p>
<blockquote class="example">In Richard&rsquo;s survival horror game, the PCs stumble into the aftermath of a zombie attack. Richard passes out a fate point to each player, with the compel &ldquo;The <strong class="aspect">Brutal and Bloody Corpse Carnage</strong> turns your stomachs. You spend several minutes throwing up and regaining your composure, which was very much a bad idea. By the time you&rsquo;ve recovered yourselves, you realize that several of the corpses have risen to their feet and are almost on top of you...&rdquo;</blockquote>
<blockquote class="example">In Elsa&rsquo;s nihilistic horror game, the investigators have discovered the imprisoned results of the cult&rsquo;s experiments. She compels one of the investigators: &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re a <strong class="aspect">Secluded Scholar</strong>, you&rsquo;re overcome with shock and disgust and scream in fright when one of the prisoners rolls over and stares at you. This goes wrong when you hear heavy feet treading on the stairs down to your level...&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>Decision-based compels driven by viscera are a great way to set up classic horror situations, like a character...</p>
<ul>
	<li>...fleeing the scene and ending up alone with something dangerous nearby</li>
	<li>...fleeing the scene and leaving behind something (or someone) important</li>
	<li>...screaming and attracting unwanted attention</li>
	<li>...ruining their tough facade in front of someone they want to impress</li>
	<li>...abandoning a carefully-prepared ambush and frantically attacking</li>
</ul>
<p>Viscera can also be used for event-based compels. These draw on the exact circumstances more than decision-based compels, but some examples include characters...</p>
<ul>
	<li>...being so distracted that they miss an ambush</li>
	<li>...being mistaken as the cause of the gore by another party</li>
	<li>...slipping in the gore and getting thoroughly covered in it</li>
	<li>...incorrectly identifying the victim because they can&rsquo;t bring themselves to look carefully</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Mental Toll of Gore</h3>
<p>Characters often want to come away from a viscera-splattered scene with something they can use as an advantage later. In horror genres with powerful monsters, these scenes offer a great opportunity to build up advantages and free invokes that can be used in a later confrontation...but not without a cost to their mental wellbeing. Rather than using compels to reflect the traumatizing experience of scenes like this, make the gore a character in the scene and have it act directly on the characters as they investigate in a contest or conflict.</p>
<p>Give the visceral mess a Gore rating, and roll attacks with it every exchange, defended by Will or Careful. A Gore rating at or slightly below the group&rsquo;s average Will rating means that characters must be cautious, since the GM has a stock of fate points per scene they can use to boost their attacks. Depending on the circumstances, the gore can roll against a single character, divide its shifts among everyone, or, for an especially challenging scene, attack everyone with its full roll.</p>
<p>Make the scene brisk, with characters creating some advantages against the threat, taking some stress and maybe a consequence, and then getting out. To change things up a bit, you could transition to a fight or a chase after an exchange or two.</p>
<blockquote class="example-start">Bruce&rsquo;s players have found some bodies half-dissolved in some malignant but dormant fungus. He&rsquo;s about to compel them to flee the scene when Marissa suggests that this is a great opportunity to learn more about the source of the fungus. After rolling to create several advantages to analyze samples of the fungus, Bruce rolls the scene&rsquo;s Gore of Good (+3) defended by Marissa&rsquo;s character&rsquo;s Fair (+2) Will and Nick&rsquo;s character&rsquo;s Average (+1) Will. Marissa&rsquo;s is fine, but Nick&rsquo;s character takes a 3-shift hit. He marks a stress box and takes a mild consequence of <strong class="aspect">Unmoored from Re</strong><strong class="aspect">ality</strong>.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="example-end">Next exchange, Nick looks at his treacherous dice and declares that he&rsquo;s conceding before Bruce rolls. Marissa&rsquo;s PC shrugs off the hit again, and Bruce and Nick decide that the fungus has begun to wake up and he&rsquo;s passed out from inhaling the spores.</blockquote>
<h3>Splatter Attacks</h3>
<p>Monster stunts are another effective way to bring viscera into play, especially in a splatter horror game. When triggered, these stunts let the monster create an advantage representing disgust or revulsion, or make a Provoke attack against all witnesses.</p>
<p>Triggers might include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>When the monster&rsquo;s target takes a consequence</li>
	<li>When the monster succeeds with style</li>
	<li>When a disgusting monster first comes into clear view</li>
	<li>When you first smell the monster&rsquo;s stench</li>
	<li>When a monster is discovered in an unexpected place, like hanging from a ceiling or moving through a pipe that should be too small for it</li>
</ul>
<p>These stunts are powerful, and should be limited&mdash;usable once per scene, requiring a fate point, or requiring an invoke of a suitable situation aspect.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Chainsaw Flourish: When the Appalachian Stalker succeeds with style on an attack with his chainsaw, the GM can spend a fate point to roll a Provoke attack against everyone else in the original target&rsquo;s zone.</blockquote>
<h3>Hardened Hearts</h3>
<p>Sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for a character to be bothered by viscera. In some subgenres of horror, especially survival or splatter horror, this works without further complication. Give your character an aspect like <strong class="aspect">Expert Surgeon</strong> or <strong class="aspect">Combat Veteran</strong> justifying why they can shrug off a bloody mess or a room strewn with internal organs. Since aspects are always true, you can use such an aspect to argue that a viscera-based compel is inappropriate, and you&rsquo;ll always have something to invoke when defending against viscera-based attacks.</p>
<p>In other genres, especially those focusing on psychological horror, this kind of hardening comes at a cost. One way to handle this is with a stunt that exchanges your internal cost for an external cost; instead of you getting grossed out, everyone nearby is disturbed by your indifference.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Inured: You&rsquo;ve got a strategy for coping with viscera and gore, but it&rsquo;s not comfortable for others. You have a sticky condition (<i class="title">Dresden Files Accelerated</i>, page 116)&mdash;<strong class="condition">Disturbingly Callous</strong> <span class="boxes">[]</span>&mdash;that you can check at any time. While it&rsquo;s checked you&rsquo;re immune to gore-based mental attacks and can&rsquo;t have visceral aspects compelled against you&mdash;but you also can&rsquo;t use or defend against the Empathy skill. To clear <strong class="condition">Disturbingly Callous</strong>, you must demonstrate that you are vulnerable and human after all, for example by making an emotional appeal in a safe place, or putting yourself in danger for your allies. Anyone without <strong class="condition">Disturbingly Callous</strong> checked adds one to the shift value of every gore attack they receive if they&rsquo;re in the same zone as someone with the condition checked.</blockquote>
<h1>Chapter 4: Who&rsquo;s Who of the Damned</h1>
<div class="subheader">Making and Playing Monsters and Other Adversaries</div>
<p>Monsters are often the real stars of horror fiction. We&rsquo;re happy to root for the protagonists, but when the story&rsquo;s over it&rsquo;s the monsters we remember.</p>
<p>But monsters are the top of a horrific iceberg, and effective adversaries come in many guises. From the manifestation of a personal fear&mdash;like dread of one&rsquo;s own capacity for evil&mdash;to body-ravaging disease, involuntary transformation, or existential threat, adversaries reflect and magnify the fears common to the human condition to scare and thrill audiences.</p>
<p>In this chapter we give you tools and techniques for making scary, memorable adversaries in your games.</p>
<h2>Making Monsters</h2>
<p>From Frankenstein&rsquo;s Creature to Jason Vorhees, there&rsquo;s a pantheon of iconic monsters that are regularly resurrected in new forms because of their enduring appeal.</p>
<h3>Media Inspiration</h3>
<p>We liberally borrowed from some classic horror movies when we were writing the advice in this section. Works that inspired us include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i class="title">Lights Out</i> is the inspiration for the <strong class="aspect">Shadow Specter</strong>. The history of this antagonist and its relationship with the protagonists is fascinating and well done.</li>
	<li><i class="title">It Follows</i> is the inspiration for the <strong class="aspect">Ineluctable Hunter</strong>. It&rsquo;s a mysterious figure about which we know almost nothing, and it doesn&rsquo;t jump out and scare you. In addition to being a great example of how the inexplicable can be scary, it&rsquo;s an object lesson in the power of suspense, and also poses an interesting moral dilemma.</li>
	<li><i class="title">A Nightmare on Elm Street</i>: Almost everyone is familiar with Freddy Krueger, the legendary monster from this series of movies. He inspired the <strong class="aspect">Nightmare Stalker</strong>. He has an interesting past, an excellent motivation for his horrendous crimes, and a beguilingly sinister personality that turned him into something of an antihero by the end of the series.</li>
	<li><i class="title">The Omen</i>: Damien, the child antagonist of this sinister movie, is the inspiration for <strong class="aspect">The Devil&rsquo;s Spawn</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>But now it&rsquo;s time to make your own monsters.</p>
<h3>Choose High Concept and Theme</h3>
<p>The best monsters have a deeper meaning or theme alongside their obvious horrific traits. Vampires are blood-sucking fiends who act as a metaphor for penetration and the corruption of sexuality. Zombies represent the inevitability of death and fear of the Apocalypse in a battle of humanity against mortality. Sometimes monsters symbolize more than one theme&mdash;a vampire might also represent a failure to join the present or let go of the past, or the sacrifice of morality on the altar of longevity and survival.</p>
<p>When you begin making a monster, consider not just what it <em class="Emphasis">is</em> but also what it <em class="Emphasis">means</em>. What does your monster symbolize, and how does it relate to the human experience?</p>
<p>Write down your monster&rsquo;s high concept aspect and a sentence or two describing its <strong class="terminology">theme</strong>. As the theme is an extension of the monster&rsquo;s high concept, you can use invokes and compels to demonstrate and reinforce it during play, even if the monster isn&rsquo;t involved in the current scene.</p>
<blockquote class="example">The <strong class="aspect">Shadow Specter</strong> is a ghost that only manifests in darkness and disappears in the light, representing the primal fear of the dark. You can offer a compel on its high concept to have the characters&rsquo; flashlights fail, plunging them into total darkness. Or you can invoke it when they&rsquo;re picking their way through a dimly-lit building even if the specter isn&rsquo;t there.</blockquote>
<p>Here are some other examples of monstrous high concepts and their associated themes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An <strong class="aspect">Ineluctable Hunter</strong> latches onto a single victim and pursues them at a walking pace until it catches and kills them, taking the concept of an obsessive stalker to a supernaturally intense conclusion.</li>
	<li>The <strong class="aspect">Nightmare Stalker</strong> is a monster that haunts people in their bad dreams, symbolizing the debilitating effect of fear itself and the terrible things people will do when they&rsquo;re afraid.</li>
	<li>A <strong class="aspect">Cursed Lycanthrope</strong> who transforms into a ravening beast on the nights of the full moon represents the fear of loss of control, of unrestrained rage and murderous intent.</li>
	<li><strong class="aspect">The Devil&rsquo;s Spawn</strong> is a murderous child with psychokinesis who embodies the fact that children are alien to adults, combined with the fear of a parent that their child might be somehow <em class="Emphasis">wrong</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Determine Threat</h3>
<p>Next, consider who&mdash;or what&mdash;your monster threatens, and how. The threat it poses is most effective if the players are invested in and care about your monster&rsquo;s targets, as we discuss in <span class="chapter-title">The Raveled Sleeve of Care</span>.</p>
<p>In the early stages of a story, it&rsquo;s better for your monster to threaten what the players care about rather than the PCs directly. Posing a direct threat to the PCs hastens a confrontation with them, reducing the time available to build mood and set appropriately high stakes for the climax.</p>
<p>If your monster <em class="Emphasis">does</em> mess directly with the characters, begin with constant small aggressions, ongoing drains on energy and emotional wellbeing. You&rsquo;ll keep them on edge, but they won&rsquo;t really be able to react in a meaningful way due to the fleeting and unpredictable nature of the interactions. Like a cat toying with its prey, the monster will make them bleed from a thousand tiny wounds before it closes for the kill.</p>
<p>But your monster doesn&rsquo;t have to pose a lethal threat to be scary and effective. In fact, a monster that tortures, mutilates, or psychologically breaks its victims can be scarier than one that flat-out murders them. Perhaps the scariest of them all is a monster that transforms its victims into something just like it. We discuss these sorts of fates in depth in <span class="chapter-title">Some Scars Are Invisible</span>, in <span class="chapter-title">Exploring Strange and Dangerous Desires</span>, and later in this chapter.</p>
<p>Your monsters can also effectively threaten things other than people. Concepts like hope, faith, love, and charity can come under attack and so can places, objects, objectives, or organizations. If a ghost starts haunting the alma mater of two of the PCs and threatens it with closure, will they idly sit by and let their college fall due to the specter&rsquo;s activities or will they do all they can to protect it? What if the players are working to redevelop a run-down district, but keep getting their workers scared out of the area by a levitating woman with a blood-red face in a tattered, flowing dress?</p>
<p>You can also threaten pets and other beloved animals with your monsters, but use this trope with particular caution. It&rsquo;s an interesting wrinkle of human psychology that you can kill as many people as you like in your fiction and most people will be fine with it, but kill one dog and you&rsquo;ll drive away a significant portion of your audience (for evidence of this we submit <em class="Emphasis">www.doesthedogdie.com</em>).</p>
<h3>Choose a Purpose</h3>
<p>You know from the previous step what or who your monster threatens; now it&rsquo;s time to decide why that is.</p>
<p>Every monster wants something. Some just want to watch the world burn; others have a specific mission of revenge or a desire to complete their final killing spree from beyond the grave. Some monsters have obvious purposes, while others act in ways that make little sense until a hidden pattern emerges.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve decided on your monster&rsquo;s <strong class="terminology">purpose</strong>, write this down as its second aspect.</p>
<p>Use the monster&rsquo;s purpose to build on its high concept and theme to make it feel like a well-rounded entity rather than a two-dimensional monster of the week.</p>
<p>Here are some example purposes for the monsters we described earlier:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <strong class="aspect">Shadow Specter</strong>&rsquo;s purpose is <strong class="aspect">Jealous Possession</strong>. It sees the woman it&rsquo;s haunting as its property and will drive away or kill anyone to whom she gets too close. It wants to be the only thing near her in the comforting darkness.</li>
	<li>The <strong class="aspect">Ineluctable Hunter</strong> seeks to <strong class="aspect">Exhaust and Kill</strong> its victims. It pursues them at a walking pace, forever, until they tire and it can finally destroy them.</li>
	<li>The <strong class="aspect">Nightmare Stalker</strong> seeks <strong class="aspect">Vengeance Visited Upon the Children</strong>. An angry specter who was murdered by vigilante parents, it now takes its revenge on the children of those who killed him.</li>
	<li>The <strong class="aspect">Cursed Lycanthrope</strong> just wants to hunt and kill in her bestial form, but more importantly she wants to <strong class="aspect">Be Cured of this Curse</strong> and will do anything it takes, no matter how heinous.</li>
	<li><strong class="aspect">The Devil&rsquo;s Spawn</strong> wants to kill people mercilessly as an example of how evil is allowed to exist in the world. His purpose is to <strong class="aspect">Obliterate Faith and Hope</strong> with his diabolical acts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Giving your monster a purpose that&rsquo;s in direct opposition to one or more characters or game aspects is a good way to make sure it naturally comes into conflict with the group. If one of the PCs is a <strong class="aspect">Troubled Priest</strong>, it&rsquo;s relatively easy to draw him into a story involving <strong class="aspect">The Devil&rsquo;s Spawn</strong>. The <strong class="aspect">Loyal Daughter</strong> of the <strong class="aspect">Shadow Specter</strong>&rsquo;s target will naturally come into conflict with the specter as she works to stay in her mother&rsquo;s life.</p>
<h3>Choose Other Aspects</h3>
<p>Once your monster has a high concept and purpose, you can use other aspects to flesh it out and make it a more vivid threat. Your monster can have as many aspects as it needs, but as a significant part of your story it should have at least as many as any other main NPC. Here are some ideas for what those aspects can be about:</p>
<p class="inline-header">Vulnerability: What can harm or kill your monster? Making this an aspect gives the players a simple way to use it to their advantage with invokes or compels. You might also say that any attacks invoking your monster&rsquo;s vulnerability can&rsquo;t be absorbed with stress boxes or that they disable any stunts that make your monster tougher. Alternatively, you can say that any attack not invoking its vulnerability simply doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Immunity: What <em class="Emphasis">can&rsquo;t</em> hurt your monster? If it&rsquo;s vulnerable to most things but immune to one common source of harm, it might be better to give it an immunity rather than a vulnerability.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Important Features: If your monster has <strong class="aspect">Prehensile Tentacles</strong> or a <strong class="aspect">Terrifying Shriek</strong>, these are good options for aspects. If you also tie these into monstrous stunts, you can make your monster significantly more dangerous.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Interests and Obsessions: If your monster has an interest or obsession above and beyond its primary purpose, it can make an interesting aspect. The vampires of Asian myth are <strong class="aspect">Obsessed with Counting</strong> for example. Such obsessions can serve as secondary vulnerabilities for your monsters or just make them more interesting and fleshed out than single-minded engines of destruction.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Limitations, Hatreds, and Fears: Does your monster have an aversion to garlic? Can it cross running water? Does it hate one type of person so much that it will prioritize attacking them over anyone else?</p>
<p class="inline-header">Positive Traits: If your monster demonstrates one or more positive traits, it can help make them feel more &ldquo;human&rdquo; and heighten the horrible things they do by contrast. You can also use your monster&rsquo;s positive traits to hint at its original identity or its weaknesses. Perhaps your monster <strong class="aspect">Never Harms Children</strong> because it was once a schoolteacher, or it <strong class="aspect">Won&rsquo;t Kill Unarmed Prey</strong> because that would be against its alien code of ethics.</p>
<h3>Choose Monstrous Skills or Approaches</h3>
<p>Using custom skills or approaches for your monsters is a good way of enhancing their theme and making them feel different from regular characters. The simplest way to do this is to simply reskin an existing skill with an appropriate name&mdash;for example, instead of Fight your serial killer might have Mutilate, or instead of Forceful your specter might have Poltergeist.</p>
<p>The other option is to create entirely new skills or approaches for your monsters. You can write down anything as a skill or approach and then judge during play when it&rsquo;s appropriate for the monster to use it during a particular situation.</p>
<p>If you want to be consistent in how you handle a monstrous skill or approach, you can write it up in full using the rules for creating extras on page 271 of <i class="title">Fate Core System</i>. This is an excellent choice if there&rsquo;s any possibility a PC might learn or obtain the ability to use the monstrous skill or approach.</p>
<blockquote class="example-start">Elsa gives her <strong class="aspect">Nightmare Stalker</strong> a skill called Nightmare which it uses to enter nightmares and attack people in their sleep. She decides to make it a full extra, because if a PC manages to get hold of the weapon the stalker used during its living rampages they&rsquo;ll gain the same ability. She writes it up like this:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="example-middle">Nightmare</blockquote>
<blockquote class="example-mid">This skill determines the character&rsquo;s ability to reach into a sleeping mind and twist a dream into a nightmare, opening a weakness through which the dreamer can be physically attacked.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="example-mid">Overcome: Nightmare can be used to overcome defensive advantages that have been created inside a dreamscape by a lucid dreamer.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="example-mid">Create Advantage: Nightmare can be used to create advantages that gradually twist a pleasant dream into a nightmare. Actively opposed by Will.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="example-mid">Attack: You can use Nightmare to attack the dreamer if you invoke an aspect you previously created with this skill. Defended by Will. Nightmare attacks can only be absorbed with mental stress boxes or physical consequence slots. Waking witnesses will see wounds opening up on the sleeper&rsquo;s body as they fill consequence slots.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="example-end">Defend: Nightmare isn&rsquo;t used to defend.</blockquote>
<h3>Choose Unique Conditions</h3>
<p>Giving your monster unique conditions (<i class="title">Dresden Files Accelerated</i>, page 116) is a good way to represent their physical characteristics, vulnerabilities, and transformations. Conditions used to flesh out a monster&rsquo;s state of being can&rsquo;t also be used to absorb conflict stress, but you can give your monsters stress-absorbing conditions as well as or instead of normal consequences.</p>
<p><strong class="terminology">Fleeting conditions</strong> can be used to represent the temporary drain of a resource that refreshes each scene.</p>
<blockquote class="example">You make a sapient plant monster that can release soporific pollen to make feeding easier. You give it a fleeting <strong class="condition">Depollenated</strong> <span class="boxes">[]</span> condition that it checks whenever it has used this ability, meaning that it can&rsquo;t use it again until the next scene.</blockquote>
<p><strong class="terminology">Sticky conditions</strong> work well to represent states that toggle on and off when particular conditions are met. You can create stunts that only function if a sticky condition is checked (or unchecked) or use a sticky condition to give your monster a new vulnerability in a particular circumstance.</p>
<blockquote class="example">See <strong class="condition">Curse of the Daystar</strong> in the entry for vampires.</blockquote>
<p><strong class="terminology">Lasting conditions</strong> are suitable for a significant drain on the monster&rsquo;s abilities or a vulnerability that has a sustained impact on the monster&rsquo;s health when it&rsquo;s triggered.</p>
<blockquote class="example">The specter of an electrocuted mass murderer must mark off a <strong class="condition">Drained</strong>&#160;<span class="boxes">[]</span> lasting condition when she uses her Lightning Soul stunt. She can&rsquo;t use the stunt again until she clears this condition, which requires her to take power from a source of electricity by making a Physique roll against Great (+4) opposition, and then waiting a full session.</blockquote>
<h3>Choose Stunts</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve chosen your creation&rsquo;s monstrous skills carefully, you probably don&rsquo;t need to give your monster stunts that give it a +2 bonus on certain actions or use a skill in an unusual way. Instead, concentrate on giving your monster stunts that reinforce its theme by letting it break the usual rules of Fate in some creepy and unsettling ways.</p>
<h4>Gaining New Stunts</h4>
<p>Your monster doesn&rsquo;t have to have all the stunts you create for it straight away. In horror fiction the threat faced by the protagonists often grows throughout the story as it &ldquo;levels up&rdquo; to meet their growing knowledge and confidence. Just when the players think they know how to deal with your monster, having it use a stunt that they haven&rsquo;t seen before is a good way to throw them into disarray and increase the drama.</p>
<p>Be fair in how you do this, though&mdash;your monsters should only gain stunts at a milestone just like the PCs.</p>
<h4>Example Stunts</h4>
<p>Dominate: Demons and vampires often have this stunt, as does any other monster that thrives on making its victims do its bidding. The monster gains a sticky condition <strong class="condition">Domination</strong> <span class="boxes">[][][]</span>. To use this stunt, the monster must meet a prerequisite like making eye contact, constructing a voodoo doll of the victim, dosing the victim with some of its saliva, or making them hear its song. It then rolls an appropriate skill to create an advantage opposed by Will to create an aspect like <strong class="aspect">Enthralled</strong> on its target. The monster can check boxes of <strong class="condition">Domination</strong> instead of spending fate points to compel or invoke <strong class="aspect">Enthralled</strong> to make a nearby victim do its bidding. The monster must rest, feed, perform a magic spell, or take another suitable action to clear out its <strong class="condition">Domination</strong> boxes.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Drain: Suitable for vampires of all kinds and any other monster that drains blood, psychic energy, etc. from a victim. On successfully attacking in a manner to feed (e.g. with fangs or by invoking an emotion to feed off) the monster can either begin the recovery of a consequence of equal or lower severity to the one taken by their opponent or gain a free invoke on their high concept to represent the surge of energy they get from feeding.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Figment (Nightmare): Roll Nightmare opposed by Will when the monster is inside a victim&rsquo;s dream to have a threatening entity from their dream materialize in the real world. The figment is a supporting NPC or a mob of nameless NPCs. The figment acts in accordance with the behavior it demonstrated in the dream and the monster does not have direct control over it.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Indestructible: Suitable for werewolves, vampires, and indestructible serial killers. When this monster is taken out, it can&rsquo;t be killed unless it has already filled its extreme consequence slot or the final attack invokes a vulnerability aspect.</p>
<p>Instead of dying, the monster flees or appears to be dead for at least a scene, and then returns when the PCs least expect it. Each player in the conflict that took the monster out gains a fate point at the end of the scene for going along with this trope. On its return, the monster clears its stress and recovers any mild, moderate, or severe consequences it has taken&mdash;except those taken from attacks that invoked one of its vulnerabilities.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Infect: Suitable for zombies, werewolves, and other monsters that transmit their curse to others, this stunt lets your monster infect an innocent victim to begin their transformation. Success with style on an attack using their teeth, fangs, claws, ovipositor, or other body weapon allows your monster to inflict the curse. Use the system (<span class="chapter-title">&ldquo;Progressive Alterations&mdash;Transformation and Degradation&rdquo;</span>) to resolve the effects of the transformation.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Lightning Soul: Works for Frankensteinian creatures, electric chair specters, and other monsters who&rsquo;ve ridden the lightning. The monster can create surges of electricity that make lights explode, short out appliances, and shock nearby people. Roll Physique to overcome or create advantages related to electricity in a zone, or to attack a single target with a surge of power from a nearby outlet. Electrical attacks have weapon rating depending on the source&mdash;a toaster has Weapon:0, while shorting out an electrical substation gives Weapon:4.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Possess: Suitable for spirits, ghosts, and demons, the monster can spiritually enter a victim and control them. After taking a victim out in a mental or physical conflict, the spirit can possess them indefinitely. They use the victim&rsquo;s physical skills but their own mental skills as appropriate. Getting rid of the spirit requires the victim&rsquo;s allies to research the correct exorcism technique and then win a conflict against the possessing spirit. If you use this on a PC, let the player continue to portray their character, but you can compel them to act in accordance with the spirit&rsquo;s purposes without giving them a fate point. The player of the possessed character can spend a fate point for their character to regain a limited amount of control for a scene, letting them oppose the possessing entity&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Remote Control: This is a classic for vampires and sirens, but it can work for other monsters that exert an uncanny hold over their victims. Requires Dominate. The monster can check a box of <strong class="condition">Domination</strong> to compel their enthralled prey no matter how far apart they are. The most common use of this stunt is to summon a victim into the monster&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Re-Zone: Once defined, zones usually stay as they are. In horror, that&rsquo;s not the case. Horror is full of experiences where zones don&rsquo;t stay static: hallways lengthen no matter how far characters run down them, buildings recede no matter how fast characters approach them, chasms suddenly open up between characters that somehow don&rsquo;t change the relationship of things around them. This stunt allows the monster to combine up to three zones into one, break a single zone into two or three, switch the places of two adjacent zones, or bridge two zones so they&rsquo;re adjacent to each other even though one or more zones lie between them. The first use of this stunt in a scene is free; after that it costs a fate point each time it&rsquo;s used.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Swarm Composition: If the swarm is composed of small, fast moving animals, it&rsquo;s difficult to inflict significant damage without fire or another area effect weapon. Any attack that doesn&rsquo;t invoke the swarm&rsquo;s vulnerability deals a maximum of one shift of stress.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Transform: Lots of monsters have the ability to take on alternative forms. When your monster has this stunt, come up with one or more sticky conditions that represent its alternative forms. These conditions can alter the monster&rsquo;s skills or approaches, change its physical abilities and vulnerabilities, lock and unlock stunts, and so on. In its most powerful form, this stunt is free to use; if you want to limit the monster&rsquo;s ability to transform, make it cost a fate point or limit its use to once per scene. For examples, see the example monsters.</p>
<h3>Introducing Your Monster</h3>
<p>Many horror movies go downhill when they reveal too much about their monsters. That which is seen in glimpses and shadows is much scarier than something that is seen fully in the light, no matter how hideous it actually is. This is an advantage that written fiction and roleplaying games have over films, because it&rsquo;s much easier to use description to reveal just what you want to the audience.</p>
<p>When you introduce your monster, tease the players with partial revelations using vivid multisensory descriptions. Over time they&rsquo;ll build up a picture in their minds of what the monster is like that will be scarier than if you describe it in detail the first time they encounter it. This is also a good way to avoid overloading your descriptions with details that can ultimately numb the experience.</p>
<blockquote class="example">In a shuttered warehouse, Elsa&rsquo;s group encounters the creature behind the current zombie outbreak for the first time. The only light entering the building is in the form of narrow and randomly placed shafts of light from bullet holes in the walls and ceiling. Elsa describes that the first thing they notice is the stench, a mixture of rot and chlorophyll green-ness. There is a heavy, wet sound pulsing from somewhere in the back of the warehouse like a gigantic heartbeat. They catch a brief glimpse of something low and multi-legged skittering through a shaft of light, a glistening brown trail left behind. What will they do now?</blockquote>
<p>To help maintain mystery and suspense, you can either keep your monster&rsquo;s aspects hidden until they&rsquo;re discovered by the PCs or you can deliberately word them in a suspenseful way. For example, rather than being an <strong class="aspect">Ancient Vampire</strong> your monster could be a <strong class="aspect">Sanguine </strong><strong class="aspect">Fiend</strong>.</p>
<h5>The Cost of Knowledge</h5>
<p>You can make learning about your monster a double-edged sword, but make sure you let your players know in advance that you&rsquo;re using this rule.</p>
<p>The PCs can learn about your monster, but it comes at a price. Whenever a player successfully declares a story detail about your monster or creates an advantage to reveal one of its aspects, add a fate point to a separate pool of points. Unlike your pool of points for the scene, points in this monster pool remain until you use them. However, you can only use them to invoke and compel aspects directly relating to the monster.</p>
<p>You can use custom fate points that represent the monster to build a bit of drama with this technique. Blood-red beads or plastic fangs for a vampire, miniature knives or tiny hockey masks for a serial killer&mdash;whatever you can find that&rsquo;s easily distinguishable from your usual fate points and appropriate to the monster will work well.</p>
<p>If multiple monsters are involved in the same scenario, only use this rule for the most significant monster in the story. At your discretion, if a monster has minions that directly relate to its theme, they can also benefit from the monster pool.</p>
<h3>Example Monsters</h3>
<p>Rather than giving you fully fleshed out examples, the following entries are designed to give you a solid core that you can improvise around to produce variations on a theme.</p>
<h4>Vampire</h4>
<p>From blood-drinking undead fiends to psychics who feed on mental energy, vampires are perennially popular in horror fiction.</p>
<p>Sample High Concepts: <strong class="aspect">Sanguine Fiend</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Ancient Leech</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Emotional Vampire</strong>, <strong class="aspect">The Blood Is th</strong><strong class="aspect">e Life</strong></p>
<p>Theme: Vampires are the embodiment of violation and the corruption of sexuality. To their victim&rsquo;s detriment, they take what they want without asking for it. Vampires also possess a dangerous allure, the draw of the predator. They penetrate with their fangs and they corrupt other people into being like them.</p>
<p>Sample Purposes: <strong class="aspect">Find My Eternal Love</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Build a New Empire of Blood and Fear</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Survive and Prosper</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Avenge Myself Upon the Descendants of My E</strong><strong class="aspect">nemies</strong></p>
<p>Sample Vulnerabilities: <strong class="aspect">Dracula&rsquo;s Banes</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Tainted Blood</strong>, <strong class="aspect">A Virgin&rsquo;s Touch</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Obsidian </strong><strong class="aspect">Blades</strong></p>
<p>Skills: Because they represent violation and corruption, vampires tend to be strong, tough, and manipulative. If you use the regular skills, focus on their Physique, Provoke, and Rapport. They will also likely have reasonable Fight, Stealth, and Athletics scores. If you use custom skills, consider giving them a Dominate skill for their ability to control and manipulate others. In the stories, vampires also often have mastery over wild animals, so consider a Beast Master skill.</p>
<p>Suggested Stunts: Dominate&mdash;Requires eye contact, or for an emotional vampire to have fed on the target, or for the victim to have tasted the vampire&rsquo;s blood (pick one); Drain&mdash;Must use this stunt to heal consequences inflicted by an attack that invoked a vulnerability; Remote Control; Transform&mdash;Bat, Wolf, or Mist form at no cost; Indestructible.</p>
<h5>Unique Conditions</h5>
<p><span class="boxes">[]</span><strong class="condition">Curse of the Daystar </strong>(sticky): Mark this condition at dawn and clear it at sunset every day. While this condition is checked, the vampire is incapable of healing or using stunts and faces a base opposition of Superb (+5) against any action it tries to take.</p>
<p><span class="boxes">[]</span><strong class="condition">Wolf Form </strong>(sticky): While in the form of a wolf, the vampire replaces its skills with three approaches called Hunt, Kill, and Run. One is rated the same as the vampire&rsquo;s apex skill, one is one lower, and the other is two lower.</p>
<p><span class="boxes">[]</span><strong class="condition">Bat Form </strong>(sticky): While in the form of a bat, the vampire replaces its skills with three approaches called Fly, Hide, and Feed. One is rated the same as the vampire&rsquo;s apex skill, one is one lower, and the other is two lower.</p>
<p><span class="boxes">[]</span><strong class="condition">Mist Form </strong>(sticky): When in mist form, the vampire can only drift at a walking pace and has no skills or approaches. It can enter anywhere that isn&rsquo;t airtight and can&rsquo;t be harmed except by an attack that invokes a vulnerability that would logically affect an immaterial form&mdash;such as fire or sunlight. The vampire cannot defend against such attacks.</p>
<h4>Slasher</h4>
<p>Slashers are apparently indestructible engines of violence. They relentlessly pursue their victims until they&rsquo;re all dead or the slasher is miraculously taken out by the final survivor.</p>
<p>Sample High Concepts: <strong class="aspect">Masked Murderer</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Spree Killer</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Vengeful Assassin</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Merciless Mut</strong><strong class="aspect">ilator</strong></p>
<p>Themes: Slashers often embody the concept of punishment or revenge. They want revenge for something you (or your family members) did or they want to punish you for having somehow transgressed&mdash;it has become a clich&eacute; that masked murderers in slasher movies go for the teens who&rsquo;ve lost their virginity first (except in <i class="title">Cherry Falls</i>, which completely inverts the trope). Slashers also represent the fear of strangers: when we&rsquo;re walking past someone late at night and they look at us a certain way, it&rsquo;s easy to imagine that they could lash out and attack us. Slashers dial that fear up to 10&mdash;if you&rsquo;re in the wrong place at the wrong time, you could be the next victim and there&rsquo;s nothing you can do about it.</p>
<p>Sample Purposes: <strong class="aspect">Revenge for What You Did</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Chasing the World Record Number of Kills</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Purify the </strong><strong class="aspect">Sinful</strong></p>
<p>Sample Vulnerabilities: Many slashers don&rsquo;t have a specific vulnerability, they just take an extreme amount of damage to put them down for good. Those who do have vulnerabilities tend to have primal ones like <strong class="aspect">Fire</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Drowning</strong>, or <strong class="aspect">Fa</strong><strong class="aspect">lling</strong>.</p>
<p>Skills: Slashers rarely interact with their victims in any way but the physical and intimidating. If you use the regular set of skills, prioritize Fight, Physique, Will, and Provoke. Consider using a stripped-down set of custom skills that really focus on what the slasher does, like Murder, Mutilate, Terrify, Destroy, and Resist.</p>
<p>Suggested Stunts: Indestructible.</p>
<h5>Unique Conditions</h5>
<p>Instead of using regular consequences and the Indestructible stunt, you can give your slasher multiple conditions that represent progress towards taking it out. Giving it three or four fleeting conditions, two or three sticky conditions and one or two lasting conditions will make it very tough! Also, instead of hindering the slasher, each condition it checks makes it more brutal and difficult to kill. </p>
<p>For example: <strong class="condition">Pissed</strong>, <strong class="condition">Brutal</strong>, <strong class="condition">Adrenaline Rush</strong> (Fleeting); <strong class="condition">Vengeful</strong>, <strong class="condition">Inured to Pain</strong> (Sticky); <strong class="condition">Berserk Frenzy</strong> (Lasting)</p>
<p>Marking one of these conditions gives the slasher an aspect of the same name and a free invoke on that aspect.</p>
<h4>The Killer Swarm</h4>
<p>While a lot of horror fiction focuses on the danger of an individual monster, there is a grand tradition in which the threat is a dangerous swarm of creatures. From <i class="title">The Birds</i> to <i class="title">Arachnophobia</i>, killer swarms have been terrifying audiences for years.</p>
<p>Sample High Concepts: <strong class="aspect">Venomous Spider Swarm</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Avian Army</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Horde of Scorpions</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Legion of La</strong><strong class="aspect">mpreys</strong></p>
<p>Themes: Swarms represent the enormity of nature and humanity&rsquo;s tenuous place within it. Humans are outnumbered enormously by other species; if they were malevolent and rallied in large numbers, they would pose a significant threat to us. The threat posed by a killer swarm is often created or magnified by humans&mdash;genetically engineered piranha, Africanized bees, spiders whose territory is invaded or destroyed by humans. In these cases, the killer swarm poses a moral lesson about tampering with nature and the cost of hubris.</p>
<p>Sample Purposes: <strong class="aspect">Protect the Queen</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Survive and Spread</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Destroy the Human </strong><strong class="aspect">Plague</strong></p>
<p>Sample Vulnerabilities: <strong class="aspect">Fire</strong> and other area-effect attacks are a vulnerability for individual swarms, but the threat as a whole can&rsquo;t be permanently dealt with unless the nest and/or queen or alpha animal is destroyed.</p>
<p>Skills: Swarms rely on weight of numbers to overwhelm their prey and to survive against attacks. If you&rsquo;re using regular skills, prioritize Fight and Physique according to the size of the swarm. While the rank and file members of the swarm are unintelligent animals, there is often an alpha or queen animal with near-human intelligence who controls the swarm and which you can generate as a full NPC with a complete set of skills.</p>
<p>Suggested Stunts: Infect&mdash;Rather than infecting the victim with a curse, the swarm poisons its victim or implants its young inside them. The victim can still be bodily transformed&mdash;perhaps into a new queen or giant version of the swarm creatures&mdash;but they&rsquo;re more likely to be poisoned or impregnated, eventually leading to a gruesome death as the poison takes its course or they burst open to give birth to thousands of new swarm members;</p>
<p>Swarm Composition.</p>
<h4>The Created</h4>
<p>Horror fiction is replete with examples of monsters created by mad scientists, sorcerers, and others. Frankenstein&rsquo;s Creature is the classic example, but there&rsquo;s also the Golem of Prague, The Mummy, and Hector the murderous robot in <i class="title">Saturn 3</i> among many more.</p>
<p>Sample High Concepts: <strong class="aspect">Murderous Robot</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Clay Avenger</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Reanimated Corpse Cr</strong><strong class="aspect">eature</strong></p>
<p>Themes: There&rsquo;s an interesting observation that &ldquo;Knowledge is knowing that Frankenstein is the creator, not the monster. Wisdom is knowing that Frankenstein is the monster.&rdquo; Horror featuring created monsters is all about the hubris of the creator rather than the villainous evil of the monster. In fact, the monster is often treated sympathetically, its bad behavior shown as an inevitable consequence of its unnatural birth. Perhaps the creation must be killed for the good of everyone, but it&rsquo;s the creator who is truly the monster. It&rsquo;s common for the creator to get their comeuppance by the end of the story, but the &ldquo;monster&rdquo; often survives for a sequel...</p>
<p>Sample Purposes: <strong class="aspect">Kill All Humans</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Murder My Creator</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Find a Purpose for My Unnatura</strong><strong class="aspect">l Life</strong></p>
<p>Sample Vulnerabilities: As a consequence of their constructed &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; nature, the created often lack any specific vulnerabilities and must simply be destroyed through overwhelming force.</p>
<p>Skills: Created monsters can have any skills, but in their role as physically unstoppable powerhouses, they will likely have good ratings in Physique and Fight. Custom skills do a good job of highlighting the monster&rsquo;s created and potentially quite focused nature, such as Dissect for a murderous surgical robot.</p>
<p>Suggested Stunts: Indestructible; Lightning Soul; Transform&mdash;Murderous robots can change form into a dangerous combat mode for the cost of a fate point (see <strong class="condition">Battle Station Mode</strong> below).</p>
<h5>Unique Conditions</h5>
<p>Conditions are a great way of representing the created monster&rsquo;s unusual physiology. Here are some possibilities:</p>
<p><span class="boxes">[]</span><strong class="condition">Lightning Struck </strong>(fleeting): After being struck by lightning or using its Lightning Soul stunt to shock itself, the monster becomes powerfully energized until the end of the scene. Immediately recover the monster&rsquo;s lowest consequence and gain two free invokes on its high concept.</p>
<p><span class="boxes">[]</span><strong class="condition">Battle Station Mode </strong>(sticky): A robotic monster changes configuration into a powerful attack form. In this mode it can&rsquo;t move zones or dodge attacks, but it gains Armor:4 and sprouts cannon, electrical generators, or another ranged weapon with Weapon:2.</p>
<h2>The Flesh Is Weak&mdash;Your&#160;Own&#160;Body&#160;as&#160;an Adversary</h2>
<p>What if your adversary isn&rsquo;t an external threat, but rather your own betraying flesh? This is the premise of body horror, defined by <i class="title">The Collins English Dictionary</i> as: &ldquo;a horror film genre in which the main feature is the graphically depicted destruction or degeneration of a human body or bodies.&rdquo; For the purposes of this section, we are broadening the definition slightly to include non-consensual bodily alteration, transformation, or loss of control.</p>
<p>We are also concentrating on the expression of body horror as pertaining to one&rsquo;s own body. We provide tools for dealing with the reaction to body horror that happens to someone else in <span class="chapter-title">The Horror of Viscera and Gore</span>.</p>
<h3>Media Inspiration</h3>
<p>The following books and movies are useful sources of inspiration to help you explore body horror themes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Many Clive Barker books, including <i class="title">Cabal</i>, <i class="title">The Books of Blood</i>, and <i class="title">The Hellbound Heart</i> all fit the bill. &ldquo;Everybody is a book of blood. Wherever we&rsquo;re opened, we&rsquo;re red.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>David Cronenberg&rsquo;s <i class="title">The Fly</i>, in which the protagonist is the victim of a matter transportation experiment that goes horribly wrong when he starts transforming into a humanoid fly.</li>
	<li>Scott Sigler&rsquo;s <i class="title">Infected</i>, which focuses on a man&rsquo;s battle with an intelligent disease that&rsquo;s infecting his body and that has its own agenda.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Idle Hands</i> and <i class="title">Evil Dead 2</i> both feature rogue body parts.</li>
	<li><i class="title">The Girl With All The Gifts</i> by M. R. Carey explores both the fear of being transformed and the fear of already being a monster, in a few different ways.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Ritual</i> by Graham Masterton. Ritual autophagy and murder as a holy sacrament feature heavily in this grisly novel.</li>
	<li><i class="title">The Thing</i>, John Carpenter&rsquo;s 1983 original is the best, though the 2011 remake is also decent.</li>
	<li><i class="title">The Metamorphosis</i> by Franz Kafka is a seminal example of a non-lethal transformation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Permanently changing a character&rsquo;s body is of great narrative and emotional significance and you must obtain enthusiastic consent from your players before you use the techniques presented here. Don&rsquo;t assume that your players are comfortable with their characters being mutilated or tortured just because they signed up for a horror game.</p>
<h3>Mutilating Injuries</h3>
<p>Physical injury or mutilation is a quick and dirty option for scaring a movie audience, because most of us automatically feel revulsion and discomfort when we see someone sustain a serious, permanent injury. This is even more potent when it happens to a player character in a roleplaying game, due to the depth of identification a player has with their character.</p>
<p>When using this trope, consider that depictions of mutilation are ultimately exploitative, in that they leverage the kinds of injuries sustained by real people every day&mdash;whether by deliberate acts or in accidents&mdash;for their shock value. It&rsquo;s fine to focus on the horrible experience a character has on sustaining a permanent injury and in dealing with the aftermath&mdash;especially in a tense survival situation&mdash;but treat the subject with respect and never imply that sustaining an injury makes someone less of a person.</p>
<p>On a similar note, don&rsquo;t use bodily mutilations or disabilities as signifiers of villainy in your NPCs. This is a lazy clich&eacute; that does nobody any good.</p>
<p>Extreme consequences already represent the very long-term repercussions of serious injuries, but if the group agrees it&rsquo;s appropriate for your game, other physical consequences can also reflect mutilation. In this case, having an <strong class="aspect">Eye Gouged Out</strong> could be a moderate consequence while a <strong class="aspect">Severed Leg</strong> would be a severe consequence. If the character has an opportunity to recover from such a consequence, it fades into being part of the character rather than an aspect to be regularly invoked or compelled. However, if a player wants to continue to focus on the effects of a mutilating injury, they can incorporate it into one of their aspects at a minor milestone in addition to the usual benefits of the milestone.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Rufio has his <strong class="aspect">Eye Gouged Out</strong> by a cultist who needs the body part for a ritual. Rufio has the injury treated and the consequence recovers at the end of the next session, but Nick decides to keep a memento of the injury. He has Rufio don a rakish eye patch and changes his high concept to <strong class="aspect">Brash One-Eyed Swashbuckler</strong> at the next minor milestone.</blockquote>
<p>If your game is really going all-out on the mutilation and bodily violence, you can also propose that a character suffers mutilation when they succeed at a major cost along with taking an appropriate consequence.</p>
<blockquote class="example">&ldquo;Well, the good news is you&rsquo;re not infected with the zombie virus anymore. The bad news is, the doctor couldn&rsquo;t purge it any other way, so he had to tie a rubber tube around your arm and saw it off just above the elbow.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>Another option is to let players buy the following stunt or, if you&rsquo;re going to the farthest extreme of splatter horror, give it to everyone in the group for free:</p>
<p class="inline-header">The Flesh Is Weak: You can have your character suffer a mutilating injury&mdash;requiring you to fill a moderate, severe, or extreme consequence slot&mdash;to automatically and without a roll:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Take out a single supporting NPC</li>
	<li>Take out a mob of nameless NPCs, or</li>
	<li>Score two victories in an ongoing contest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, see <span class="chapter-title">&ldquo;The Book of Scars&rdquo;</span> for a system that makes <em class="Emphasis">all</em> consequences leave scars, even after the injuries that caused them have healed.</p>
<h3>Progressive Alterations&mdash;Transformation and Degeneration</h3>
<p>The total or partial transformation of a protagonist into something unpleasant or disgusting is a staple of the body horror genre. In David Cronenberg&rsquo;s <i class="title">The Fly</i>, a man gradually metamorphoses into a human-fly hybrid. In H.P. Lovecraft&rsquo;s <i class="title">The Shadow Over Innsmouth</i>, the protagonist realizes that he too is a descendent of Dagon and will become a Deep One in time. And in a plethora of zombie movies, we witness victims struggling with infected bites until they ultimately succumb and become undead monsters.</p>
<p>We present here two slightly different systems you can use to tell stories like these about the progressive permanent alteration of characters. The first is ideal for alterations that completely destroy the character, either by making them unplayable as a PC&mdash;such as turning them into a shambling zombie incapable of anything but groaning and hunting for fresh meat&mdash;or by killing them outright. The second is better suited for alterations which are permanent and unpleasant, but which don&rsquo;t prevent the character from being played at least somewhat normally&mdash;for example, being turned into a vampire or a Deep One.</p>
<h3>Fatal Alterations</h3>
<p>Use physical consequences to progress the transformation. Once a consequence slot is filled with a transformation consequence, it can&rsquo;t be healed without extraordinary circumstances. To help the player enjoy their gruesome transformation, give them the free invoke on their new &ldquo;feature.&rdquo; See <span class="chapter-title">&ldquo;Progressing Transformations&rdquo;</span> for guidance on when this happens.</p>
<p>This system evokes the genre by making it a relatively fast process from beginning the transformation into a monster or puddle of molten flesh to being taken out. Marking the first transformation consequence is the beginning of the end for the character.</p>
<p>If you take out a character with transformation consequences in a conflict and their player agrees, you can have them complete the transformation.</p>
<h3>Survivable Alterations</h3>
<p>For slower-paced transformations, especially where the character will remain playable at the end, use a set of custom conditions (<i class="title">Dresden Files Accelerated</i>, page 116) in addition to the character&rsquo;s standard stress, consequences, or conditions.</p>
<p>Transformation conditions are all Lasting and can&rsquo;t be cured without extraordinary circumstances. For example, in <i class="title">Dracula</i> Mina Harker&rsquo;s <strong class="condition">Thrice-Bitten</strong> condition that dooms her to become a vampire if she dies is only cured at Dracula&rsquo;s final death.</p>
<p>When the character marks a transformation condition, they gain an aspect of the same name and a free invoke on that aspect.</p>
<p>If the character is called upon to mark a transformation condition and can&rsquo;t, they complete their transformation and change their high concept aspect to reflect their new nature. All of their transformation conditions are removed and incorporated into their new high concept.</p>
<blockquote class="example-start">In Cronenberg&rsquo;s <i class="title">The Fly</i>, when Brundle is turning into Brundlefly he has the following transformation conditions:</blockquote>
<blockquote class="example-mid"><strong class="condition">Hairs Where They Don&rsquo;t Belong</strong>, <strong class="condition">Teeth and Fingernails Falling Out</strong>, <strong class="condition">Liquid Diet</strong>, <strong class="condition">Compound Eyes</strong>, and <strong class="condition">Emerging Fly </strong><strong class="condition">Limbs</strong>.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="example-end">When Brundle needs to mark another transformation condition and can&rsquo;t, he changes his high concept from <strong class="aspect">Shy Physicist</strong> to <strong class="aspect">Brundlefly</strong>. He loses all of his transformation conditions because they are encompassed by his new high concept.</blockquote>
<h3>Progressing Transformations</h3>
<p>Whether you use consequences or conditions, there are a couple of options for determining when the character must take another step towards their transformation.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You can build the transformation as an extra (<i class="title">Fate Core System,</i> page 271) and have it attack the character periodically (e.g. once a scene or session) or when a trigger is met (e.g. when the character becomes significantly stressed).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="example">Elsa decides the Z-Virus has a single skill of Zombify at Superb (+5) and it attacks an infected character once every scene, defended by Physique.</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>This technique is useful in other ways: if the transformation is curable, you can give it a Resistance skill that lets it fight back against attempts to cure it. You can also give it skills or stunts that the infected player can access once they reach a certain stage of infection.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="example">Elsa gives her Z-Virus a stunt called Corpse Flesh that an infectee gains once they&rsquo;ve taken a moderate or worse consequence from the virus. The stunt reflects that their body is becoming numb and it makes them immune to invokes on their physical consequences.</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>You can have them mark off a consequence or condition without any kind of defense either periodically or when a trigger is met.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Mental Consequences of Body Horror</h3>
<p>Physical consequences work well for representing many types of body horror. When your body is changed involuntarily, a large part of the trauma is psychological, however, and you can use mental consequences&mdash;or situation aspects relating to your state of mind&mdash;to highlight this.</p>
<p class="inline-header"><strong class="aspect">Worried About Losing More Teeth</strong>: You lost a tooth last week. It was a bit wobbly, then when you brushed your teeth and spat, it just flew out with a click into the sink. Your other teeth are starting to feel loose, and you&rsquo;re paranoid about losing more of them.</p>
<p class="inline-header"><strong class="aspect">Everyone Keeps Staring at Me</strong>: Since you started to grow scales and your skin turned a blotchy gray-green, you&rsquo;re convinced everyone is looking at you all the time. It&rsquo;s really beginning to play on your nerves.</p>
<h3>Rogue Body Parts</h3>
<p>Alien Hand Syndrome is a real-life condition where a person&rsquo;s hand sometimes moves without their conscious control, and in its best documented cases resulted from separation of the right and left hemispheres of the brain. In horror stories such as Clive Barker&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Body Politic&rdquo; or the movies <i class="title">Idle Hands</i> and <i class="title">Evil Dead 2</i>, the syndrome is exaggerated to a horrific conclusion, in which the hand is not just out of the person&rsquo;s control but rather malevolent and destructive.</p>
<p>To evoke this trope, you can create a character representing the victim&rsquo;s disobedient hand and use it to torment the character. But why should hands get all the fun? There are plenty of other body parts that can go rogue and cause grief for their owners.</p>
<p>In the following examples of rogue body parts, we&rsquo;ve used conditions (<i class="title">Dresden Files Accelerated</i>, page 116) to represent each part&rsquo;s ability to resist attempts to control them. While a PC has a checked condition on a rogue body part, they have an aspect of the same name (but it doesn&rsquo;t get free invokes). If the character manages to take out their rogue body part during a conflict, they regain control over it until a later compel sets it off again.</p>
<p>If the rogue body part manages to take out the character, it means the character has been forced to cut it off (or out), or it has freed itself, and it can now pursue its unholy agenda separate from its original body.</p>
<p>Permanently curing a rogue body part means finding the cause of the issue and dealing with it, such as vanquishing the demon possessing it.</p>
<h5>Hand/Arm</h5>
<h6>Notes</h6>
<div>This is the classic example. Your rogue hand and arm can oppose anything you try to do and can take independent actions to annoy, hurt, or inconvenience you. Your rogue hand has all the same skills you do.</div>
<h6>Stress</h6>
<p>Physical <span class="boxes">[1][2]</span></p>
<h6>Conditions</h6>
<p><strong class="condition">Pins &amp; Needles</strong> (fleeting), <strong class="condition">Dead Arm</strong> (sticky, lasts until you have a chance to shake some blood into it and have a brief rest), <strong class="condition">Broken Arm</strong> (lasting, until splinted and cast)</p>
<h5>Tongue</h5>
<h6>Notes</h6>
<div>Your rogue tongue can talk for whatever malevolent force is possessing you, embarrass you by sticking itself out at people in social situations, or mess you up by twisting your words as they come out so you say something you didn&rsquo;t mean to say. It can only attack you when you&rsquo;re eating, and it does so by sticking itself out of your mouth quickly in hopes of being bitten off! Severed tongues move about like slugs and can&rsquo;t really achieve much...but a swarm of them might be able to overcome someone and choke them to death.</div>
<h6>Skills</h6>
<p>Good (+3): Deceive (can oppose the character&rsquo;s Rapport, Provoke, or Deceive rolls), Provoke</p>
<p>Average (+1): Bite me!</p>
<h6>Stress</h6>
<p>Physical <span class="boxes">[1]</span></p>
<h6>Conditions</h6>
<p><strong class="condition">Swollen Tongue</strong> (fleeting), <strong class="condition">Half Chewed-Off Tongue</strong> (lasting, requires medical attention and rest to recover)</p>
<h5>Heart</h5>
<h6>Notes</h6>
<div>If your heart takes you out, it can choose to kill you by punching itself out of your chest. If it does this, it extricates itself from your body with a significant portion of your circulatory system, allowing it to move around and grapple using your veins and arteries in a squid-like fashion. While it remains inside you, it has limited options for messing with you, but it can attack you by refusing to beat, make you feel woozy by beating slowly or irregularly (arrhythmia), or make you anxious with unpleasant palpitations. You can defend against its efforts with your Physique as you strike your ribcage or solar plexus (or use a defibrillator) to bring it back under control.</div>
<h6>Skills</h6>
<p>Great (+4): Heart Attack</p>
<p>Good (+3): Arrhythmia, Palpitations</p>
<h6>Stress</h6>
<p>Physical: <span class="boxes">[1]</span></p>
<h6>Conditions</h6>
<p><strong class="condition">Chest Pains</strong> (sticky, cured by a few hours of sleep), <strong class="condition">Fractured Ribs</strong> (lasting, cured by avoiding strenuous activity for a few days)</p>
<h5>Eye</h5>
<h6>Notes</h6>
<div>Your rogue eye can see for whatever malevolent force is controlling it, or give you hideous visions that are hard to distinguish from reality. It can also inconvenience you by swiveling out of sync with the other eye, forcing you to either close it or get disorienting double vision. It can also dilate or contract its pupil to half blind you. If it gets ripped out, your eye can ambulate on its ocular muscles, moving around a bit like a crab with its optic nerve trailing behind like a tail. It can&rsquo;t attack you outright.</div>
<h6>Skills</h6>
<p>Good (+3): Blind, Disorient</p>
<h6>Stress</h6>
<p>Physical: <span class="boxes">[1]</span></p>
<h6>Conditions</h6>
<p><strong class="condition">Sore Eye</strong> (fleeting), <strong class="condition">Badly Bloodshot Eye</strong> (sticky, cured by an eye bath), <strong class="condition">Weeping Blood</strong> (lasting, requires rest and bandaging until healed)</p>
<h2>The Other&mdash;Ideas, Regimes, and Wholly Alien Adversaries</h2>
<p>The Other is any opponent with the ability and will to change the characters&rsquo; natures. Horror scenarios with the Other as antagonist throw the characters into a struggle to define their very selves. This type of horror is innately personal and internal, and therefore calls for an extra round of care before, during, and after the game for the wellbeing of the real people playing.</p>
<h3>Media Inspiration</h3>
<p>Our focus here is on the Other as a force of repression to be overcome or, conversely, initially unwanted but ultimately liberating change. These are a few of the works that inspired us:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i class="title">Skin Folk</i> by Nalo Hopkinson is a collection of short stories based on the theme of facades and the real people inside our skins.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Suffered From the Night: Queering Stoker&rsquo;s Dracula</i>, edited by Steve Berman, is an anthology of short stories that shows just how many directions open up when authors revisit old, familiar material without narrow assumptions. This volume contains an exuberant variety of reinterpreted histories, relationships, and outcomes.</li>
	<li><i class="title">The Drowning Girl</i>, by Caitlin R. Kiernan, is a harrowing tale narrated by a schizophrenic woman trying to make sense of experiences that may be hauntings or may just be symptoms. The trans woman she&rsquo;s in love with plays a crucial part in separating true life and imagination, while the mysterious woman who sometimes stalks her gains power in part from the social norms that push the narrator and her girlfriend to the margins. It&rsquo;s an intense novel, sometimes grueling to read (as it was to write), but the rewards are great.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Occultation and Other Stories</i>, by Laird Barron, includes the novella &ldquo;Mysterium Tremendous&rdquo;. Barron tells the story of two gay couples whose camping vacation turns into utter ruin, and shows the difference between writing about characters being gay and writing about characters who are gay.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Gothika</i> has a protagonist who&rsquo;s opposed by people who should be helping her because they believe she&rsquo;s mentally ill.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Cabal</i> by Clive Barker, filmed as <i class="title">Nightbreed</i>, features someone in a confrontation with a supernatural Other who comes to realize that the Other is not the enemy.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Get Out</i> is a modern classic exploring themes of racism and racial fetishism in a terrifying and claustrophobic way.</li>
	<li><i class="title">1984</i> by George Orwell is the seminal example of a dystopian, all-controlling, all-seeing government. It&rsquo;s also a great example of something that wasn&rsquo;t written or marketed as horror, but which works great for horror anyway.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Is the Other?</h3>
<p>The concept of an enemy that wants to shape its victims in its own image is one we see again and again. We humans fear threats to our sense of self and to what we consider acceptable society. We find it easy to personify a whole group or set of groups that threaten these things as one entity: the Other.</p>
<p>The Other in your game may be a purely mundane force of political tyranny that wants its subjects not just to submit, but to embrace their submission.</p>
<blockquote class="example">George Orwell&rsquo;s Big Brother from <i class="title">1984</i> is the archetypal modern example of a political Other, and Winston Smith&rsquo;s final submission is a classic example of what losing to the Other means. He comes to find his own actual life less interesting and trustworthy than the day&rsquo;s lies about industrial production and warfare. Everything that made Winston an individual ultimately yields to the Party&rsquo;s idea of what he ought to be.</blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, the Other may be a supernatural, alien, or otherwise exotic threat to life as the characters wish to lead it. Possibilities include literal aliens, viral/sentient ideas, elder gods or other Cthulhu Mythos-ish ancient evils, and artificial intelligences.</p>
<blockquote class="example">In <i class="title">They Live</i>, the Other is an alien race that hides in plain sight and rules humanity with subliminal messages so they&rsquo;re unaware of their subjugation.</blockquote>
<p>Our identities are fragile in many ways, and can be threatened from almost any direction, with some emotional and experiential similarities regardless of the threat&rsquo;s origin. Whatever people find strange, hard to comprehend, and threatening can become the Other, and the Other is a monster to be defeated.</p>
<h4>On Othering People</h4>
<p>Horror fiction often has a conservative, even reactionary, streak. People who dare to have sex out of wedlock are punished. Gay characters are presented as creepy and unnatural because of their sexuality. The Black character often dies first. As part of this trend, the Other has historically been used to embody the forces of change and diversity perceived to threaten an idealized, old-fashioned, small-town community.</p>
<p>Othering the &ldquo;weirdos&rdquo; who believed in racial equality, the worth of women, and the naturalness of non-straight relationships was rarely part of a calculated agenda, but the things that everyone involved with a project took for granted show where an era&rsquo;s fears lay.</p>
<p>Instead of looking to the conservative roots of horror, we have chosen here to focus on the example set by horror writers who belong to various marginalized, oppressed groups. They have taken the notion of the Other and subverted it in two different directions:</p>
<p class="inline-header">Redefining the Other: It turns out that the threat is not the outsiders, but the mainstream that won&rsquo;t engage with them as equals. Whether the outsiders win or lose a battle against the Other, they&rsquo;re the ones championing values of personal freedom, civilization, and community.</p>
<blockquote class="example">In <i class="title">Gothika</i>, the institutional forces that the protagonist would normally turn to for help immediately flip against her once she&rsquo;s got the stigmatizing label of being mentally ill following her experiences with ghosts. After that, everything she sees and learns becomes only evidence of her mental illness, and confirmation that she needs to be locked up.</blockquote>
<p class="inline-header">Embracing the Other: It turns out that the outsiders have qualities that make them fundamentally unlike the mainstream force fighting them...and that&rsquo;s just fine. The outsiders&rsquo; Otherness isn&rsquo;t harmful, although it threatens the comfort and security of those who shun Otherness.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Clive Barker&rsquo;s works including <i class="title">Cabal</i> and <i class="title">The Hellbound Heart</i> are prominent examples of this. He evokes the gay experience of accepting one&rsquo;s difference from others&mdash;and one&rsquo;s similarity to others who&rsquo;ve been excluded and shunned&mdash;in his characters who discover that what the world sees as monstrous has its own wonder and even beauty.</blockquote>
<h4>Creating the Other</h4>
<p>In a Fate game, the Other is a fractal NPC consisting of one or more of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An Other-as-entity NPC representing the totality of the Other</li>
	<li>Sub-groups of entities within the Other, each with a specific purpose and created as NPCs</li>
	<li>The individual entities that together comprise the Other</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating the Other-as-entity is a very similar process to making a monster. Give the Other:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A high concept aspect and theme</li>
	<li>A purpose aspect</li>
	<li>One or two other aspects that define it. Use these to flesh out its nature and the threat it poses. If it has vulnerability aspects, they reflect institutional blind spots and other large-scale flaws rather than physical weaknesses.</li>
	<li>A few custom skills that reflect its strengths and method of operation. Its apex skills should be at least one or two steps higher on the Fate ladder than the group&rsquo;s current skill cap; it is an overwhelming threat.</li>
	<li>At least one custom skill at Poor (-1) or Terrible (-2) to exemplify something it is <em class="Emphasis">not</em> very good at</li>
	<li>Two or three stunts that reinforce the Other&rsquo;s areas of competence or ability to achieve feats that others can&rsquo;t</li>
</ul>
<p>Repeat these steps as necessary to create smaller sub-groups of the Other, such as departments of a government or corporation or special-purpose teams. Sub-groups can share skills and stunts with the Other-as-entity or have completely different traits.</p>
<p>Finally, create individual entities that make up the Other, either as monsters or regular nameless, supporting, or main NPCs depending on their role in the story.</p>
<p>How far you need to drill down when you&rsquo;re creating the Other and/or its constituent parts depends on the Other&rsquo;s role in your story and the scale of the conflicts you&rsquo;re planning. If the PCs are part of a coherent organization that can rally significant resources, then you can resolve conflicts at the Other-as-entity level. If, however, the characters are a group of rough sleepers fighting a shadowy organization that&rsquo;s kidnapping and brainwashing them, they can&rsquo;t&mdash;initially at least&mdash;meaningfully affect the Other-as-entity and must instead interact with its individual members or small sub-groups.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Bruce&rsquo;s game is based on <i class="title">1984</i>, so he writes up Party mastermind O&rsquo;Brien and a few low-ranking officials the characters frequently encounter, then creates the rest of the Party as a single entity whose aspects, skills, approaches, and stunts cover its vast human and physical resources, its psychological penetration of culture and language, and so on.</blockquote>
<h5>Giving the Other Scale</h5>
<p>The PCs face overwhelmingly difficult opposition if they try to confront the Other-as-entity without having resources of a similar scale at their disposal. Using the scale rules from <i class="title">Dresden Files Accelerated</i> (page 182) is a good way to handle a disparity of power between the Other and the group without having to give the Other-as-entity very high skills ratings. There are five levels of scale from Mundane to Godlike. Each level of scale over an adversary gives the acting character +1 to their roll, +2 shifts if their roll is successful, or an extra free invoke on a create advantage roll opposed by their adversary.</p>
<h5>Means of Resistance</h5>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fundamental choice to discuss when setting up a game featuring the Other: what kinds of resistance are effective?</p>
<p>The straightforward answer is &ldquo;any means necessary.&rdquo; Society at large may come to think of the characters as terrorists, but their violence can be very effective and justified by the nature of the threat posed by the Other. In a game with an action-movie level of depth, it may not even be an issue&mdash;of course the characters are justified, they&rsquo;re the heroes. In games with more depth, there will either be enough people in authority to recognize the necessity of the character&rsquo;s actions for a heroic outcome, or there won&rsquo;t, and the characters will face condemnation and maybe worse.</p>
<p>Where the Other is providing a social critique by its very nature, often haphazard violence <em class="Emphasis">won&rsquo;t</em> work, on the principle that using the enemy&rsquo;s tools brings the characters halfway toward being the enemy themselves. The characters must find other ways to strike back: peaceful sabotage against brutal violence, careful planning and/or surreal chaos-making against physically overwhelming force, magic against materialistic tyranny that denies the spiritual.</p>
<p>If violence against the Other is truly not the best strategy, change the rules of the game to reinforce this fact. Either flat-out say that attacks against the Other don&rsquo;t work, or impose a cost every time someone attacks the Other, regardless of whether their roll is successful.</p>
<h3>Confronting the Other</h3>
<p>Confrontations with the Other move through three stages: initial conflict, a threshold moment of critical vulnerability, and transformation&mdash;whether that means becoming the Other, changing the Other so it&rsquo;s no longer a threat to the self, or changing oneself into something capable of resisting the Other.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to complete all three steps or cover each of them in detail, especially not in games intended to be short or where you just want to focus on part of the process.</p>
<h4>Initial Conflict</h4>
<p>During this phase of the game, the characters and the Other discover each other as threats and begin to clash with increasing intensity. The Other isn&rsquo;t deliberately hunting for the characters, and initially brushes up against them as typical interference in its business from the not-yet-subjugated world. The characters likely aren&rsquo;t hunting the Other either, and experience its presence as apparently random difficulties in going about their business, violence or chaos in their environment, or increasingly suspicious patterns of recurring hardship for people like them.</p>
<h5>Recognition</h5>
<p>After a few such encounters, play out a pivotal scene in which the characters and the Other finally come to recognize the threat they each pose to one another. This is a contest, challenge, or minor conflict in which the PCs are directly opposed by agents of the Other and finally come to realize its existence as a coherent foe rather than a series of coincidental problems.</p>
<p>Discovering the Other&rsquo;s existence and responding to it challenges the characters&rsquo; worldview, even when it&rsquo;s essentially a natural force at work. The Other confirms every paranoid fear&mdash;the kind we usually try to talk each other out of&mdash;and adds that, yes, it&rsquo;s all very much planned, not just improvised by fumbling would-be authorities who share our frailties. The individual or group at the top has a purity of vision, a capacity for disregarding normal human impulses; they are unlike most people, including the characters.</p>
<h5>Feeling Out the Opposition</h5>
<p>Once they notice each other&rsquo;s existence, over subsequent scenes each side acts to discover more about the opposition. The PCs can investigate the Other by taking create an advantage or overcome actions, completing challenges, or engaging in contests with the Other to obtain intelligence or material evidence. Meanwhile, the Other probes them in return. The way actions are carried out on both sides brings the nature of the Other into tangible experience.</p>
<p>An institutional, bureaucratic Other can flood the characters with weird but not entirely unjustifiable demands for disclosure of paperwork, registration forms, and duplicate documents. A viral idea or parasitical Other can &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; a separate person&rsquo;s body for each encounter, wrapping the characters in an endless procession of strangers who seem to all share a certain set of quirks reflecting their unseen masters at work. An eldritch Other can prey on the characters in non-physical ways, haunting them with ghosts or visions using the rules. Others can be very inventive, stealthy, and unsettling in their methods, and part of your job as GM is to convey the sense of a power playing by its own rules.</p>
<p>Isolation is a crucial element of the strategy used by every Other. It tries to cut off characters from their allies, friends, and families, from their sources of income, from places that have been secure and safe. The characters&rsquo; response to these threats exposes more of the Other&rsquo;s scope of influence and shows them the fate of others who resisted and lost.</p>
<h4>Threshold</h4>
<p>Soon the Other understands the characters well enough&mdash;or thinks it does&mdash;and begins to attack their essential selves. There&rsquo;s a moment where this phase of the struggle begins. In movies, it&rsquo;s often an instant of unexpected violence or other tragedy framed by silence as the characters face their changed situation in stunned surprise. In books and comics, it&rsquo;s the cliffhanger ending of a story arc and the beginning of a new one.</p>
<p>Discuss the threshold criteria for your game with the players during game creation. Examples of good thresholds include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A character suffers a severe consequence from the Other&rsquo;s actions (or the second time a character suffers a severe consequence, if you want the conflict to last a bit longer)</li>
	<li>A character concedes (or is taken out) in a struggle against the Other</li>
	<li>One or more characters lose something vitally important, like a spouse or home</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of the length of your game, the moment of threshold is a major milestone.</p>
<h4>Transformation</h4>
<p>This is where the characters themselves become the front line of the struggle. The Other has a target list of personality traits it wants to suppress, and others it wants to mandate. Since every human thought is a very complex product of very complex inputs, the Other can&rsquo;t just decree that all its subjects will hold a specific list of ideas. What it can do is set attitudes and priorities.</p>
<p>Transforming a PC in this way requires the Other to inflict mental or physical harm on them in a conflict.</p>
<p>First, the Other must establish narrative permission to transform the PC by engineering a situation that allows them to do so. The exact preparations required depend on the Other&rsquo;s nature, aspects, and skills.</p>
<blockquote class="example">The cockroaches of the post-human age&mdash;here in the present to steer our apocalypse&mdash;need to prepare a special brainwashing larva in advance, grapple a target during a conflict, and then successfully attack them to insert the larva into their ear.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="example">Big Brother&rsquo;s Party uses incarceration, beatings, and brainwashing in secure facilities to transform their opponents, requiring a PC to be taken out and transported before the process&mdash;a mental conflict&mdash;can begin.</blockquote>
<p>Once the Other has established the conditions required for transformation, it can attach a sticky checked condition (<i class="title">Dresden Files Accelerated</i>, page 116) to a single moderate, severe, or extreme consequence taken by the PC during the conflict. While checked, the condition has a rules effect&mdash;about equivalent to a stunt&mdash;that furthers the Other&rsquo;s agenda.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Big Brother inflicts a moderate consequence on a meddling reporter and gives her the condition <strong class="condition">Nothing to See Here</strong> <span class="boxes">[]</span>. While this is checked, the reporter gets +2 opposition on rolls to investigate the Party.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="example">The cockroaches inflict a severe consequence and a brain larva on a World Health Organization doctor and give them the condition <strong class="condition">They Had It Coming</strong> <span class="boxes">[]</span>. While this is checked, when the doctor treats a consequence on an enemy of the roaches, the consequence goes into recovery as normal but heals as if it were one step worse.</blockquote>
<p>The transformation condition is unchecked when the consequence it&rsquo;s attached to is cleared. If the Other successfully transforms the PC again later, it can re-check the same condition or replace it with a new one as it prefers.</p>
<p>In the very long term, the Other&rsquo;s goal is to inflict extreme consequences on the PCs to establish character aspects like <strong class="aspect">Enemies Aren&rsquo;t News, by Definition</strong> and <strong class="aspect">The Only Good Human Is a Devoured </strong><strong class="aspect">Human</strong>.</p>
<p>How the PC feels about an imposed condition or aspect is up to the player, within the boundaries of the Other&rsquo;s agenda. It may seem completely normal to the character, or it may feel weird and inappropriate.</p>
<h4>Endgame</h4>
<p>It is quite likely that the characters will lose their struggle. They often do in horror stories with this kind of conflict. But sometimes getting lost in the Other&rsquo;s grasp isn&rsquo;t the end of the story. There&rsquo;s a tradition of characters being partly or entirely consumed and yet returning to themselves (even if scarred and traumatized) and being able to help others escape the Other&rsquo;s clutches.</p>
<p>Once a character has an extreme consequence due to the Other&rsquo;s efforts at transformation, the Other can turn them into a fully willing pawn the next time it takes them out. This turns them into a main NPC, immediately recovers all their consequence slots, and permanently checks their current set of transformation conditions.</p>
<p>For the PCs to liberate a pawn of the Other&mdash;regardless of whether they were ever a PC&mdash;the circumstances must be created to justify a deprogramming attempt. The liberation then proceeds as a mirror image of the original transformation process: once in each conflict, the liberators can inflict a consequence on the pawn and uncheck one of their transformation conditions. Once all of the pawn&rsquo;s transformation conditions are unchecked, they are removed from the Other&rsquo;s control.</p>
<p>Characters emerge from such rescue operations with only dim, fuzzy memories of what it was like to be subjugated by the Other. If they spend time in self-analysis and seeking others&rsquo; help to understand their experiences, players can choose to use the next milestone to recover those memories instead of spending it on the usual options. Characters with recovered memories now know what happened to them while the Other was in control, and come out with useful insights; they gain a stunt specifically to be used against the Other.</p>
<p>The Other as a whole becomes aware of liberation attempts only when the characters fail, or when they succeed and the newly liberated target disappears from the Other&rsquo;s awareness altogether. This makes it possible to assemble a force capable of resistance using of some of the Other&rsquo;s own assets. Finally, there can be an epic showdown, with the smoke of conflict clearing to reveal whether the Other is still standing or not.</p>
<h4>Other Others</h4>
<p>Here are two variations on the theme.</p>
<h5>The Other as Liberator</h5>
<p>This option draws on the tradition of Others who are symbols of <em class="Emphasis">desirable</em> alternatives to mundane existence: living without fear or compromise as a person of an ethnicity, or sexual orientation, or gender identity, or disability, or some other quality that the mainstream hates and fears. Some people find it unsuitably campy or trivializing. Others find it an important part of the Other&rsquo;s symbolic power: it turns out that normality is far short of human potential, and that liberated humanity is much more than anyone still in subjugation knows.</p>
<p>The first stage of confrontation unfolds as usual, because the Other is at this point still a largely unknown menace, an unsettling possibility almost entirely obscured.</p>
<p>Things change when characters hit the threshold. Now they see the Other for what it is&mdash;a possible future for themselves set free of the constraints that have made their lives miserable (or worse). At each significant milestone, they can make improvements reflecting their better understanding. This is a kind of mystical enlightenment, and can unlock powers beyond normal human boundaries.</p>
<p>Options include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Raising a skill or approach beyond normal human limits, and without the usual skill pyramid limits</li>
	<li>Allowing the purchase of stunts or extras reflecting physical transformation or outright psychic, supernatural, or other powers. Powers like those in <i class="title">Venture City</i> and <i class="title">Psychedemia</i> can appear in horror play as eerie, world-transforming abilities that are threatening to those still in the old way of understanding.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="example">Tristan is already one of the best verbal aggro generators in the world, with Provoke at Superb (+5). After a series of clashes with the memetic parasite that is the Other, Tristan also has fresh insights into how human minds deal with conceptual assault. Tristan takes advantage of the next significant milestone to raise Provoke to Fantastic (+6), and doesn&rsquo;t have to advance two other skills to Superb (and the cascading requirements down the pyramid) before being able to do so. Now, when Tristan needles and unsettles, targets <i class="title">really</i> don&rsquo;t know what hit them.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="example-start">Rosario has always tried to flee violence. After a confrontation with the homophobic and racist pre-human entity that is the Other, mental barriers peel back, and the next significant milestone goes to acquiring another stunt. It buys Super Speed from <i class="title">Venture City</i> (page 63), with the Speed Demon collateral damage effect and a horror-oriented drawback. Any time Rosario uses Super Speed two or more turns in a row, first her clothing and then her skin burns away, trailing away as ash and cinders; when Rosario slows down to normal speed again, observers see a person burned from head to foot. This doesn&rsquo;t harm Rosario, but it requires cleanup and fresh clothes to shed the raw-meat look.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="example-end">Future minor and significant milestones can give Rosario additional stunts for developing this power. There&rsquo;s also potential for consequences and dangerous aspects&mdash;Rosario might come to feel <strong class="aspect">My Body Is My Own, the Hell With Anyone With a Problem About It</strong> or <strong class="aspect">If Norms Mattered that Much, I&rsquo;d Just Stand </strong><strong class="aspect">Still</strong>.</blockquote>
<p>This sort of transformation always comes at some cost, even when it&rsquo;s a cost the character pays gladly. Stepping outside the normal range of human possibility opens up new prospects, including the prospect of regarding humanity as inferior to one&rsquo;s new self. In horror, every great gift has the potential to become a great weapon, which might end up aimed at its own wielder or at others. Empowered characters inevitably face temptations to use their new powers in ways that turn other people into mere objects, and what they do in response will drive much of the ensuing story.</p>
<p>The characters&rsquo; transformation may or may not be visible to the outside world. There&rsquo;s a tradition of it being very visible indeed, the characters gaining wings, scales, hair, eyes, and skin in unique colors, and more fantastic, grotesque options like skin and bones folded and bent to make harps, knives, or lenses. Exterior exuberance expresses inward delight.</p>
<p>Once the characters have embraced the Other and their transformation by it, a second Other, the embodiment of the Old Order, now comes into play as the <em class="Emphasis">real</em> enemy of the characters and their kind. Create this new Other using the rules with a focus on regaining the old status quo.</p>
<p>When the Old Order manages to transform characters who&rsquo;ve become part of the original Other, it focuses on restoring the traits the characters replaced during transformation. Its threat begins by forcing the characters back into their old selves and lives; whether they retain any clear memories of what they were becoming is up to the Old Order.</p>
<h5>The Other as Chaos</h5>
<p>The Other can serve as a mechanical representation of world-breaking chaos, rather than a force with a clear agenda. At the beginning of play, each player writes one of their character&rsquo;s aspects on a card or slip of paper. The GM shuffles them together. When the Other inflicts an extreme consequence and thus has the opportunity to impose its agenda, draw an aspect at random. It replaces one of the character&rsquo;s existing aspects, chosen either at random or by the player.</p>
<p>For even deeper chaos, also do one or both of these:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Include at least one of each character&rsquo;s skills, approaches, or stunts as well. Targeted characters may end up with traits that aren&rsquo;t even the same <em class="Emphasis">kind</em> of trait that they lost.</li>
	<li>Include traits from example NPCs written for other settings. They don&rsquo;t have to be possible within the parameters of the game&rsquo;s world as established so far, since this represents reality falling over. Characters could end up partially embodying characters they regard as fictional, as well as possibilities they&rsquo;d never considered.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Chapter 5: We&#160;Are&#160;All&#160;Going to Die</h1>
<div class="subheader">Tools for running games where doom is inevitable.</div>
<p>Not every story has a happy ending. Horror fiction is often tragic; even if it <em class="Emphasis">looks</em> like things have ended well for the characters, there&rsquo;s often a final twist or sting in the tail that casts the finale in a different light.</p>
<p>In a horror game, the PCs won&rsquo;t always win. Hell, they may not even <em class="Emphasis">survive</em>. Risk and uncertainty are vital parts of the horror experience, and the odds of emerging at the end of a story unscathed are vanishingly small.</p>
<p>But some horror stories take things further than that: the protagonists are doomed from the start, and nobody is under any illusions that there might be a happy ending.</p>
<p>This chapter provides tools for evoking doomed horror in your games in a way that your players will enjoy rather than resent.</p>
<h2>Media Inspiration</h2>
<p>These are a few of the sources that inspired us when we were writing this chapter:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i class="title">Swift to Chase</i> by Laird Barron has several interweaving stories about a supernatural serial killer in Alaska, and the ways those who escape are twisted by the experience.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Spider</i> by Patrick McGrath: Distrust the ending as Spider should.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Devil&rsquo;s Pass</i> is one of the few really good found-footage films, about American film students investigating a historical mountaineering disaster and falling into the remains of Soviet military research and holes in time.</li>
	<li><i class="title">The Nightmare Factory</i> by Thomas Ligotti has the most doomed artists and scholars since Lovecraft.</li>
	<li><i class="title">The Bridge</i> by John Skipp &amp; Craig Spector. Like every horror/disaster novel, but we all lose.</li>
	<li><i class="title">The Mist</i> by Stephen King, though it&rsquo;s the film adaptation that has an ending like a punch in the gut.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Play if We Know How the Story Ends?</h2>
<p>Genres exist because people like certain combinations of story ingredients and want to enjoy fresh stories that contain them. Genre authors become famous for their ability take familiar ingredients and make them into something exciting.</p>
<p>The same is true of your game. When players come seeking a zombie story, it&rsquo;s a safe bet that they want to interact with a collapsed or collapsing society, struggles within and between groups of survivors, lots of zombies, and real danger for the characters&mdash;including some or all of them dying along the way. That&rsquo;s the recipe, and as GM, you aren&rsquo;t insulting the players&rsquo; intelligence by using a good recipe for zombie drama and adventure when that&rsquo;s exactly what they want.</p>
<p>Even knowing the ending in advance&mdash;or at least the general kind of ending&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t spoil the fun. After all, <i class="title">Titanic</i> was the world&rsquo;s highest grossing film for ten years after its release despite audiences knowing the ending.</p>
<p>Stories about characters doomed to die appear in many genres, from entirely naturalistic tales of criminals fighting the law and each other to supernatural stories of the whole world crumbling into a metaphysical abyss.</p>
<p>Whatever doom may be waiting, the story&rsquo;s not done until all of the characters are.</p>
<h3>The Journey, Not the Destination</h3>
<p>Knowing the broad strokes of your game&rsquo;s ending lets the players focus on their journey through the game. What surprises happen and what can they achieve along the way? What unexpected complications arise that may even threaten the overall recipe&mdash;and how can the characters get back on track? There&rsquo;s plenty of room for you to bring creativity to bear in a game about characters with known fates.</p>
<p>But why bother? What can doomed characters achieve that&rsquo;s worth playing out?</p>
<ul>
	<li>Survive as long as they can: People in general prefer to live, and PCs are no exception. This is their last chance to use all of the resources at their disposal and show the world (and themselves) just how good they are. See <span class="chapter-title">Chapter 6: The High Cost of Living</span> for a campaign framework focused on the trials and costs of survival.</li>
	<li>Understand their doom: Intimations of doom often arrive with a lot of mystery. Why is the driver they can&rsquo;t even see trying to run them down? Who is the masked person that&rsquo;s trying to chop them up, and why are they doing it? Who unleashed the zombie plague, and can <em class="Emphasis">anyone</em> survive it?</li>
	<li>Achieve goals that will outlast their doom: Can they save their children so something of them will live on? Can they secure this archeological discovery before the plague gets them? Can they make one recording-worthy performance of a symphony before the meteor hits? Can they secure this valley with a holy aura so their animals will be safe from the demon armies?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Game Creation: Building the Doom</h2>
<p>In addition to the current and impending issues in your game about doomed characters, formalize the doom itself as the <strong class="terminology">doom issue</strong> aspect. You can do this during game creation or, if you plan for your game to last for multiple sessions, after a prelude session featuring the PCs&rsquo; regular lives. That way you can tailor the doom issue to the strengths and weaknesses the players revealed in play.</p>
<p>Here are some things to consider when creating the doom issue for your game.</p>
<h3>Scale and Context</h3>
<p>Decide the overall scale of the doom. Are the PCs <strong class="aspect">Trapped by a Wildfire</strong>, trying to rescue as many others as they can before being cut off? Are they part of an international network of scientists, politicians, and others working to preserve something of humanity from an <strong class="aspect">Incoming Asteroid</strong>? Small and large scale dooms can both be emotionally engaging.</p>
<p>Context is also important when considering the doom&rsquo;s impact. The wildfire peril is a less overwhelming threat if the characters can communicate rapidly and reliably with regional and national authorities, and the asteroid&rsquo;s threat lessens if there&rsquo;s any kind of space travel that <em class="Emphasis">might</em> be scaled up for mass evacuation.</p>
<h3>Timeline and Complications</h3>
<p>At some point, the PCs know their doom is coming&mdash;unless everyone in the group is enough into irony to play a few sessions of mundane life followed by the GM announcing, &ldquo;And now you&rsquo;re all dead.&rdquo; But some dooms come with more warning than others. How much normal life do the characters get to experience, and how quickly does the doom develop once it appears?</p>
<p>Doom usually comes gradually. Natural and supernatural disasters leave people free to choose to cooperate or compete, to share information or hoard it, to plan or panic.</p>
<p>Create group aspects, issues, or setting aspects with the doom issue to focus the game on things the PCs want to use, prevent, or achieve as things go from bad to worse during the game. The tsunami created by a supervolcano&rsquo;s eruption doesn&rsquo;t stop the evil cultists from <strong class="aspect">Trying to Unleash Elder Gods</strong> until it drowns them; field scientists who know they&rsquo;re doomed continue to gather data <strong class="aspect">To Prepare Future Scien</strong><strong class="aspect">tists</strong>.</p>
<p>Is the doom already upon the PCs at the start of the game? Coming in one session, or a few? The quicker doom comes, the less room there is for issues that aren&rsquo;t part of it. The longer the game, the more opportunity there is for play to wander into a tangle of complications.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll use the <strong class="terminology">doom clock</strong> to keep track of the PCs&rsquo; progress toward their doom, so decide together how many hours there are to midnight when the game begins, and what circumstances will make it tick forwards and backwards.</p>
<h3>Internal vs. External Doom</h3>
<p>How much does the PCs&rsquo; doom depend on who they are and what they do? Could they avoid their fate if they changed themselves, or is it an external power beyond their control?</p>
<p>Some dooms are entirely internal: a gang of criminals who fall out with each other and drive themselves into a confrontation that destroys them all; obsessed magicians who reject all warnings to give up their current pursuit until the thing they&rsquo;ve summoned eats them all; rival chieftains of small tribes who refuse to cooperate in a defensive alliance and are slaughtered by invading Romans. Even when there&rsquo;s an external threat, the real doom comes from the PCs&rsquo; choices&mdash;if they chose differently, they would escape their fate.</p>
<p>Other dooms are entirely external: the Yellowstone supervolcano erupts; a plague with no cure sweeps the land; the Earth&rsquo;s poles shift just like the crank psychics said they would. None of these depends on who the characters are, and their responses may not ultimately matter to anyone else.</p>
<p>Many dooms combine internal and external elements: the zombie apocalypse isn&rsquo;t the characters&rsquo; fault, but their greed and paranoia are; the wildfires engulfing the mountains around the characters&rsquo; campground aren&rsquo;t their fault, but the hostility that disrupts efforts to fight the fires is; World War II isn&rsquo;t the characters&rsquo; fault, but their xenophobia that makes their espionage attempts easy to discover is.</p>
<h2>Doom During the Game</h2>
<p>The doom issue goes a long way toward setting up the PCs&rsquo; inevitable fate in your game, but these rules help you to reinforce the themes of doomed horror during play.</p>
<h3>The Doom Clock</h3>
<p>The doom clock is like a stress track, but arranged like a clock to really drive home the metaphor of a countdown to the end. As the characters make things worse, or fail to stop antagonists from making it worse, the clock ticks closer to midnight; on the occasions when they manage to make things significantly better, the players push the hands back as doomsday temporarily recedes.</p>
<p>Each tick of the doom clock moves it one hour closer to midnight. The game&rsquo;s overall pace depends on how close to midnight it already is when play begins. Starting at 10 o&rsquo;clock, so two ticks will initiate the endgame, is a good pace for a single-session game. Starting at 6 o&rsquo;clock, it will take a few sessions to tick to midnight, particularly if the characters earn a few opportunities to move it back an hour along the way.</p>
<p>When the doom clock runs out, the game begins to wind down. This is the point where it&rsquo;s clear that nothing the characters can do will make any material difference: their doom is upon them. The characters get a final scene&mdash;or more, up to a whole final session in longer-running games&mdash;to take their final actions and explore their final feelings. Do they go out with hope, despair, resignation, useless resolve to go down fighting? This is when you all find out, and then the curtain rings down on the show.</p>
<p>For more open-ended play, don&rsquo;t initiate the endgame the first time the doom clock strikes midnight. Instead, significantly worsen the characters&rsquo; situation&mdash;manifest a major new threat or issue, have something dreadful happen to a place or person important to the characters, remove or corrupt an important NPC or aspect&mdash;and then start counting down again.</p>
<p>The doom clock can only be set back every so often. The default is once per scene, no matter how many times in that scene various characters do things that justify moving it back. Allow moving it back more often for a more heroic flavor, or less often&mdash;down to only once per session or not at all&mdash;for play that emphasizes doom whose pace is as certain as its outcome.</p>
<h4>Scheduled Events</h4>
<p>You can use the doom clock to build tension by scheduling dramatic complications to occur when the doom clock strikes specific hours; this works most effectively if the players have a rough idea of what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Bruce&rsquo;s group is trying to defend their village from silent zombies. Each time the doom clock ticks, Bruce tells the group that the foul, obscuring fog blowing in from the sea is getting closer...and it will arrive when the doom clock strikes eleven.</blockquote>
<h4>Making the Doom Clock Tick</h4>
<p>The circumstances that make the doom clock tick forwards and backwards are vital to the feel of the game. Choosing them calls attention to which changes matter most in the group&rsquo;s struggle to survive.</p>
<p>Decide as a group what makes the doom clock tick:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A PC is taken out</li>
	<li>A PC chooses to concede</li>
	<li>All of the PCs are out of fate points</li>
	<li>A significant NPC ally is taken out</li>
</ul>
<p>Then decide what (if anything) makes the doom clock tick backwards:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A character succeeds with style (once per scene only)</li>
	<li>The PCs resolve a setting issue</li>
	<li>The PCs make a lasting change for the better</li>
	<li>The PCs reach a major milestone</li>
</ul>
<p>Or come up with your own circumstances for each. For a shorter or more heavily planned game, it works very well if you tie ticks of the doom clock to specific in-game events&mdash;for example, &ldquo;Tick the doom clock backwards if the PCs rescue Mark from the mine shaft. If they leave him to die, tick forwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only hard rule is that it must be much harder to make the clock tick backwards than forwards, unless you want the potential for the doom to be indefinitely delayed!</p>
<h3>The Fifth Outcome: Failure With Style</h3>
<p>Failure is an important ingredient of doomed horror, and adding this outcome emphasizes the role of heroic self-sacrifice and the rewards of difficult choices. When you really want to ramp up the tone of desperate struggle, you can even remove success with style as an option and add this in its place, so the four outcomes are weighted toward failure with or without some mitigation.</p>
<p>If a character rolls at least 2 shifts less than their opposition, they fail with style. They may also choose to fail with style on any failure. Whenever a character fails with style, their opponent succeeds with style.</p>
<p>If a character fails with style, they have no option for success at a cost&mdash;failure is guaranteed.</p>
<p>Narrate the character&rsquo;s failure at the intended task, and also the stroke of luck, the unexpected reward on the margins for heroic effort, or whatever else it is that gives the benefit. Depending on the tone of your game, this can be anything from sensible but dramatic to ludicrously over-the-top implausible. Enrich your game in ways that suit what you&rsquo;re all trying to do.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the next scene, the player who failed with style gains a special token that lets them do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Gain a free invoke on an aspect of their choice</li>
	<li>Remove a single free invoke of their choice</li>
	<li>Step the doom clock back one hour&mdash;this can only happen once per session, no matter how often players fail with style</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefit gained from the token must follow logically from the narration of their failure.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Marissa&rsquo;s character Kelly is trying to stay hidden from the threat that&rsquo;s stalking the group. She fails her Stealth roll with style and narrates how the monster drags her out from her hiding place by the ankle, gloating about how powerful and perceptive it is. Later, Marissa uses her failure with style token to gain a free invoke on the threat&rsquo;s <strong class="aspect">Egotistical Warlock</strong> aspect.</blockquote>
<p>A player can only hold one failure with style token. If they already have a failure with style token at the start of a new scene and are supposed to earn another, they can instead pass it to another character as long as they can narrate how this occurs.</p>
<h3>The Book of Scars</h3>
<p>In a game of doomed horror, injuries&mdash;mental and physical&mdash;leave permanent scars. Every PC gains an additional aspect, <strong class="aspect">The Book of Scars</strong>. Whenever the PC recovers from a moderate, severe, or extreme consequence (or a sticky or lasting condition), their player writes down a suitable scar on their sheet that is counted as a sub-part of <strong class="aspect">The Book of </strong><strong class="aspect">Scars</strong>.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Rufio had his eye gouged out by evil cultists and wrote down <em class="Emphasis">Gaping Socket</em> next to his <strong class="aspect">The Book of Scars</strong> aspect.</blockquote>
<p>Each PC can have five scars in <strong class="aspect">The Book of Scars</strong>. Once the book is full, the character can&rsquo;t ever clear out their moderate, severe, or extreme consequence slots (or recover from sticky or lasting conditions).</p>
<p>Medical treatment renames the consequence as normal (e.g., <strong class="aspect">Broken Leg</strong> becomes <strong class="aspect">Splinted Leg</strong>) but the consequence will never fully recover.</p>
<h3>Now That You&rsquo;ve Lost</h3>
<p>Death is <em class="Emphasis">always</em> on the table if a PC is taken out in a game of doomed horror.</p>
<p>However, unless you&rsquo;re playing with a GM and a single player, it&rsquo;s not likely that all the PCs will be taken out in the same scene&mdash;at least until the doom clock ticks its last. Some are likely to survive quite a bit longer than others. Should players pay a penalty for their characters&rsquo; inability to survive? Of course not. They can continue to play their character as a ghost with the rules, or they can turn against their fellow players and work to hasten their downfall...</p>
<p>If a player&rsquo;s ghost is taken out, or they&rsquo;d rather turn to the dark side straight away, they can say goodbye to their character and help you bring doom to the survivors by playing part of the opposition. If there&rsquo;s a supporting NPC handy, you can ask them to take over playing it, with suitable private briefings about what they should know to do their doom-ward part. Alternatively, you can work together, applying the principles of the Fate fractal, to make an NPC out of some part of the doom: bad weather, a mob of strangers all subject to the same hateful frenzy, a band of zombies roaming together. If the threat is defeated, that part of the doom is lessened, and the survivors earn a step back on the doom clock. Then the player can pick up and play another portion of the doom: survivors are limited but there&rsquo;s plenty of doom for everyone...</p>
<h1>Chapter 6: The High Cost of Living</h1>
<div class="subheader">Campaign framework for survival games</div>
<p>The framework provided in this chapter is to help you run games where the PCs face danger from an overwhelming threat and their continued survival is a result of caution, preparation, resource management, and cleverness rather than the repeated application of physical violence. This framework combines well with the doom mechanics from <span class="chapter-title">Chapter 5: We Are All Going to Die</span>, but works equally well if you leave the PCs&rsquo; fate entirely in their own hands.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, the PCs are accompanied by NPC survivors. Some are close friends and family members created by the players, and the rest are less significant NPCs.</p>
<p>The PCs have to manage the resources needed by the survivors and handle conflicts arising as a result of prejudice, incompatible moral codes, and differences of opinion on what&rsquo;s best for the group.</p>
<p>Can they maintain their humanity as the group of survivors is whittled down one by one, until only they remain? And when they&rsquo;re all that&rsquo;s left, is there anything they won&rsquo;t do to survive?</p>
<h2>Media Inspiration</h2>
<p>The following books, movies, and TV give an idea of the style of game this framework is designed to evoke:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i class="title">Night of the Living Dead</i>, <i class="title">Dawn of the Dead</i>, and <i class="title">Day of the Dead</i> are the grandfathers of the zombie survival genre.</li>
	<li><i class="title">The Stand</i> by Stephen King is a story about survivors in the aftermath of an apocalyptic flu epidemic, though there&rsquo;s also a more supernatural antagonist involved...</li>
	<li><i class="title">28 Days Later</i> is a great reference for &ldquo;fast zombies&rdquo;&mdash;the infected are alive, but reduced to animalistic, predatory behavior.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Alien</i> and <i class="title">Aliens</i> are both stories about surviving against an overwhelmingly superior foe, using whatever resources are available.</li>
	<li><i class="title">The Mist</i>: Based on a short story by Stephen King, the movie is a chilling example of how your fellow survivors are the real crux of drama in a survival horror story.</li>
	<li><i class="title">World War Z</i> by Max Brooks is much better than the film adaptation. It&rsquo;s presented as a series of interviews, found footage, and other documentary evidence of the global war against zombies.</li>
	<li><i class="title">The Fireman</i> by Joe Hill would also fit well in the section about the Other, as it features an us vs. them narrative between the infected and baseline humanity. In the aftermath of an infection that causes people to spontaneously combust, survivors who are infected but don&rsquo;t burn try to survive in a world that fears them.</li>
	<li><i class="title">The Girl with all the Gifts</i>, a novel by M. R. Carey that was recently adapted as a film. It&rsquo;s unusual in that its protagonist is one of the infected, and it&rsquo;s not just the baseline humans who want or deserve to survive the events of the story.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Arachnophobia</i>, a movie about a small town trying to survive an onslaught of deadly spiders.</li>
</ul>
<h2>General Notes and Major Rules Changes</h2>
<p>The PCs and the group of NPCs they have fallen in with are collectively referred to as <strong class="terminology">survivors</strong> in this framework.</p>
<p>PCs have no stress and must absorb any hits with consequences...but can kill or maim an NPC instead.</p>
<p>Survivors can&rsquo;t recover from consequences (or sticky and lasting conditions) without invoking <strong class="aspect">Medical Supplies</strong> or a similar <strong class="terminology">consumable</strong> or situation aspect.</p>
<h2>Game Creation</h2>
<p>Choose the consumables your group will be tracking and decide how many free invokes on each consumable the group has as the game begins.</p>
<p>As a group, decide how many supporting and nameless NPC survivors are with you. A larger group requires more consumables, but provides more characters to sacrifice on the altar of your own survival. A good starting point is to use three times the number of players as your pool of supporting and nameless survivors.</p>
<p>A third of these are supporting NPCs (<i class="title">Fate Core System</i> page 218). As a group, give each of them a high concept and a trouble.</p>
<p>The remaining survivors are nameless NPCs. They act as background color and cannon fodder, so for now just write down how many there are.</p>
<blockquote class="example">If your game has five players, there are fifteen supporting and nameless NPC survivors, of which five are supporting NPCs and ten are nameless NPCs.</blockquote>
<p>The systems for doomed horror work particularly well with this framework. As a group, decide whether you&rsquo;re using the doom issue, doom clock, failure with style, and/or the book of scars.</p>
<h2>Character Creation</h2>
<p>In addition to their PC, each player makes a main NPC survivor (<i class="title">Fate Core System</i> page 220) with a positive relationship to their character. The player initially chooses the NPC&rsquo;s high concept and trouble and their peak skill or approach; the rest of their traits can be filled out during play. One of each PC&rsquo;s aspects must include their relationship with the main NPC they created.</p>
<p>At least two of each PC&rsquo;s aspects must create tension between them and other PCs or main NPCs. </p>
<blockquote class="example">Nick&rsquo;s character has <strong class="aspect">Natural Born Leader</strong> while Sarah&rsquo;s has <strong class="aspect">Nobody Bosses Me Ar</strong><strong class="aspect">ound</strong>. </blockquote>
<h2>During Play</h2>
<p>We present here three systems that neatly fit together to evoke the tropes of survival horror. The characters must manage survival resources, watch NPC survivors die one by one around them, and build and maintain safe havens to protect themselves from the threat that assails them.</p>
<h3>Not Enough Resources to Go Around: Consumables</h3>
<p><strong class="terminology">Consumables</strong> are aspects that define the resources your group needs to survive. During game creation, pick three to five to keep track of according to the scenario. A zombie story might use <strong class="aspect">Food Supplies</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Ammunition</strong>, and <strong class="aspect">Medical Supplies</strong> while a Mad Max style story might focus on <strong class="aspect">Water</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Ammunition</strong>, and <strong class="aspect">Fuel</strong>. Consumables can be invoked normally during the game, for example by bartering <strong class="aspect">Ammunition</strong> for favors from other survivors.</p>
<p>One or more of the consumables is a <strong class="terminology">necessity</strong> for survival, for example <strong class="aspect">Food Supplies</strong> in a zombie story.</p>
<p>Each survivor&mdash;including NPCs&mdash;must periodically burn a free invoke on each necessity just to stay healthy. Survivors can&rsquo;t invoke necessities with fate points to survive.</p>
<p>The rate at which necessities are consumed depends on the game&rsquo;s pace. If your zombie scenario plays out over a few days, survivors must invoke <strong class="aspect">Food Supplies</strong> at the main mealtime every day. If the scenario spans months, survivors might have to invoke every Sunday instead.</p>
<p>You can also have two necessities with different consumption rates&mdash;for example, <strong class="aspect">Food Supplies</strong> must be invoked monthly but <strong class="aspect">Water Supplies</strong> weekly.</p>
<p>Decide how many free invokes each consumable has when the game begins. The players can add more invokes during the game. Fewer invokes, especially on a necessity, increases the pressure on the survivors:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you want the game to have a desperate feel from the start, give them free invokes on necessities equal to the number of survivors or fewer.</li>
	<li>If you want the game to start a bit more relaxed and get tenser over time, give them invokes on necessities equal to twice the number of survivors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using physical objects to represent necessities (for example, pretend plastic food to serve as food or band-aids to represent medical supplies) is a great way of giving players a constant reminder of how few resources they have.</p>
<h5>Consumables Rules Summary</h5>
<p>Consumables are aspects used to track resources needed by the survivors. Each game has three to five, one or more of which is a necessity like food or water. Free invokes on consumables can be used to help the survivors, and can be gained by scavenging, trade, etc.</p>
<p>Every survivor must spend a free invoke on each necessity periodically. Water might be once a day, food once a week, and so on.</p>
<p>If a survivor is called on to invoke a necessity and can&rsquo;t, they must decrease an appropriate skill (usually Physique) by one or take a consequence.</p>
<p>If two survivors are on half-rations, they use one invoke on the rationed necessity between them, but gain a situation aspect representing their privation.</p>
<p>A survivor who has reduced skills or taken consequences from going without a necessity can use an extra free invoke on the consumable to recover a point of the skill or, if the skill is back to normal, to begin recovering a consequence taken from privation.</p>
<h5>Consumables in Shorter Games</h5>
<p>If your game is designed to take place over a single night of in-game time or less, such as when you&rsquo;re telling a story about a serial killer stalking college kids one fateful evening, tracking three consumables is unnecessary. Just pick one like <strong class="aspect">Medical Supplies</strong> that is sure to become relevant in a short amount of in-game time.</p>
<h4>Going Without</h4>
<p>When a survivor goes without using a free invoke on a necessity they can either:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Reduce their Physique (or Forceful, if using approaches) by one to a minimum of Terrible (-2). To save the player from having to rearrange their skill pyramid, the skill stays where it is on their character sheet, but is treated as its lower value for all purposes.</li>
	<li>Take a consequence.</li>
</ul>
<p>If they can&rsquo;t do either, they are taken out.</p>
<h5>Reducing Different Skills or Approaches</h5>
<p>You might decide that it makes more sense to reduce a different skill or approach when the survivors run short of a necessity. For example, if they run short of <strong class="aspect">Scent-Blocking Cream</strong> in a zombie game, it reduces their Stealth (or Sneaky) as their enticing smell becomes easier for zombies to notice.</p>
<h5>Half-Rations</h5>
<p>Some or all of the survivors can go on half-rations to eke out a necessity. Every two survivors on half-rations use one free invoke between them. However, anyone on half-rations gains a negative situation aspect.</p>
<blockquote class="example">The group&rsquo;s <strong class="aspect">Food Supplies</strong> necessity has 11 free invokes. They need 14 to feed all the survivors, so they&rsquo;re short by three. The group puts the six nameless NPCs on half-rations, meaning they only use three free invokes and there&rsquo;s now enough food to go around. The nameless NPCs get a <strong class="aspect">Desperately Hungry</strong> aspect that Elsa writes down, planning to compel it later to inspire a revolt of the starving against the well fed.</blockquote>
<h4>Recovering from Lack of Necessities</h4>
<p>When a survivor is called upon to invoke a necessity, they can use a second free invoke to recover their Physique or Forceful by one.</p>
<p>If their Physique is at its normal rating, they can instead use a second free invoke to immediately begin the recovery of a consequence taken due to a lack of the necessity.</p>
<p>Survivors can&rsquo;t use more than one additional free invoke on a necessity in this way.</p>
<h4>Using Consumables</h4>
<p>Consumables are normal situation aspects and can be invoked on any appropriate roll. If you have a surplus of food, you can stock up to help you with a feat of physical endurance, or you can trade supplies of ammunition or water with a rival faction to aid you in a negotiation. You can also spend a fate point to invoke a consumable if you narrate how you use it to your advantage without consuming it; for example, using food to lure some rivals into a trap.</p>
<h4>Gaining Free Invokes on Consumables</h4>
<p>PCs can create an advantage to add free invokes to a consumable as long as they can justify how. Be strict on this; it will kill the tension if the survivors can easily add to their resources. You can award any number of free invokes on one or more consumables because of the PCs discovering supplies through exploration or making deals with other factions during the course of the game.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to spend a lot of time on finding supplies, you can instead use a special type of contest to quickly resolve a scavenging expedition.</p>
<p>First, determine the threat faced by the players on their mission. The usual rules for playing the opposition on page 222 of <i class="title">Fate Core System</i> apply.</p>
<p>In each exchange of the contest, the threat attacks one or more of the PCs rather than competing for victories, and the players roll against passive opposition guided by how far they&rsquo;re going and how many consumables are available in the target area. Opposition increases on successive scavenging expeditions as the PCs deplete nearby resources and must go farther afield.</p>
<p>PCs can stop at any time, or keep going to accrue more victories. Without three victories the scavenging expedition fails, and they can&rsquo;t take any consumables back. Otherwise, they can distribute two free invokes among appropriate consumables for each victory achieved.</p>
<h5>Sending NPCs to Scavenge</h5>
<p>The PCs can order a group of NPCs to go and scavenge resources on their behalf, but at a cost. Roll a single attack against the NPCs while one of the players rolls to defend. Each shift the GM gets kills a nameless NPC or deals a consequence to a supporting or main NPC. If there are any NPCs left alive, they return home with one free invoke for each NPC sent on the mission to be put on a consumable of the players&rsquo; choice.</p>
<h4>Desperate Measures</h4>
<p>Players can take desperate measures to get free invokes on some consumables. For example, you can sacrifice an NPC to gain a number of free invokes on your <strong class="aspect">Food Supplies</strong> equal to their Physique.</p>
<h3>Whittling Down the Survivors</h3>
<p>In a typical survival horror story, at best only a few people survive. The following system is designed to evoke this experience by: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Ensuring that the PCs are the last survivors.</li>
	<li>Generating tension and drama through the death and maiming of the PCs&rsquo; allies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because your character has no stress boxes, the only way to avoid being taken out is to take consequences or to sacrifice an NPC survivor to take the hit for you.</p>
<p>The NPC doesn&rsquo;t have to be in the same scene. For example, if you&rsquo;re out scavenging for supplies and would be bitten by a zombie, your boyfriend back at the mall can still take the hit for you&mdash;when you get back, you discover he&rsquo;s been bitten by an undead infant that managed to crawl into the base.</p>
<p>An NPC&rsquo;s ability to absorb harm on your behalf depends on their significance and your relationship to them.</p>
<h5>NPC Survivor Consequence Summary</h5>
<p>Instead of their PC taking a mild consequence, a player can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Severely maim a nameless NPC (effectively an extreme consequence from which they&rsquo;ll never heal).</li>
	<li>Have a supporting NPC take an extreme consequence.</li>
	<li>Have a main NPC with whom the PC shares a positive relationship aspect take a moderate consequence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of their PC taking a moderate consequence a player can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Have a nameless NPC die horribly.</li>
	<li>Have a supporting NPC with whom the PC shares a positive relationship take an extreme consequence.</li>
	<li>Have a main NPC with whom the PC shares a positive relationship aspect take a severe consequence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of their PC taking a severe consequence a player can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Have a supporting NPC with whom the PC shares a positive relationship aspect die horribly.</li>
	<li>Have a main NPC with whom the PC shares a positive relationship aspect take an extreme consequence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of their PC taking an extreme consequence a player can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Have a main NPC with whom the PC shares a positive relationship die horribly or permanently become an enemy to the group.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Nameless NPCs</h4>
<p>These folks are doomed to a short lifespan once the horror begins. Their purpose is to demonstrate the danger of the situation and to be a drain on consumables, while adding a bit of drama to the game.</p>
<p>You can have a nameless NPC suffer a nigh mortal wound, severe maiming, zombie infection, or catastrophe of similar magnitude&mdash;effectively an extreme consequence from which they can never recover&mdash;to avoid a mild consequence.</p>
<p>Having a nameless NPC die gruesomely lets you avoid taking a moderate consequence.</p>
<h4>Supporting NPCs</h4>
<p>These characters are given enough characterization that it will cause a minor downbeat in the story if one of them is killed or maimed.</p>
<p>You can have a supporting NPC take an extreme consequence (<i class="title">Fate Core System</i> page 162) to avoid a mild consequence.</p>
<p>If you or the NPC have an aspect describing a positive relationship, you can have them take an extreme consequence to avoid a moderate consequence, or have them die or otherwise be permanently removed from the game to avoid a severe consequence.</p>
<p>When a supporting NPC dies, at the next minor milestone promote a nameless NPC to a supporting NPC.</p>
<h4>Main NPCs</h4>
<p>Each main NPC is created exactly like a player character. They are important secondary protagonists, and it will cause a major downbeat in the story if one of them is killed or maimed.</p>
<p>A main NPC can only take consequences for you if you have a significant, important relationship with the NPC as described by one or more character aspects.</p>
<p>A main NPC can take a consequence for you to avoid a consequence one less severe. That is, you can have a main NPC take an extreme consequence so that you avoid a severe consequence, and so on.</p>
<p>You also can have a main NPC die horribly or become a permanent enemy (through descending into violent insanity, becoming a zombie, etc.) to avoid an extreme consequence.</p>
<p>If another PC has a character aspect relating them to the main NPC that you are sacrificing, they may reject your sacrifice by giving you a fate point. If they do this you must find another way to absorb the damage.</p>
<p>When a main NPC dies or permanently becomes an enemy, at the next minor milestone promote a supporting NPC to a main NPC, and a nameless NPC to a supporting NPC.</p>
<h3>Managing &ldquo;Safe&rdquo; Havens</h3>
<p>We described in <span class="chapter-title">Chapter 2: The Raveled Sleeve of Care</span> how the tension in a horror story follows a pattern like a heartbeat, with peaks and lulls. In a survival horror game, when danger is all around, there needs to be somewhere reasonably safe in which these lulls can occur...but it mustn&rsquo;t ever be <em class="Emphasis">too</em> safe.</p>
<h4>Designing a Safe Haven</h4>
<p>The PCs might start out with a haven when the game begins, or you might have to find one in play. Designing one is the same either way:</p>
<p>Choose a double-edged aspect that defines the haven.</p>
<blockquote class="example">The mall is well-stocked, and thus a target for desperate, potentially violent survivors. It&rsquo;s also a juicy target for the zombie horde, so the group chooses <strong class="aspect">The Smart Brains Shop at the </strong><strong class="aspect">Mall</strong>. </blockquote>
<p>Choose an aspect that describes the haven&rsquo;s biggest drawback or vulnerability.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Once a safe drive along the highway from the city, it&rsquo;s now difficult to get from the mall to the city and vice versa. <strong class="aspect">In the Middle of Nowhere</strong> works well to reflect its isolated nature.</blockquote>
<p>Give the haven a Defend skill, which reflects how well protected it is against external threats. A military barracks with razorwire fences and trenches around the perimeter has Superb (+5) Defend while a trailer park has Average (+1) Defend.</p>
<blockquote class="example">The mall has toughened glass doors and frontages with security grilles. It&rsquo;s out of the way and has good sight lines on the surroundings, so the group decides its Defend is Good (+3).</blockquote>
<p>The haven has no stress but has mild, moderate, and severe consequence slots. If it&rsquo;s taken out, the haven is destroyed or becomes overrun and the group must flee to find another haven.</p>
<p>Draw up a quick map of the haven and divide it into zones. This will come in handy when the haven is threatened.</p>
<h4>Attacks on a Haven</h4>
<p>The survivors&rsquo; haven can be attacked at any time. Often this will be during a calm moment, but it can also ratchet up the tension if an attack comes right in the middle of another crisis.</p>
<p>Use a full conflict scene to resolve the attack if:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The survivors notice the attack coming and mobilize to intercept the attackers outside the haven.</li>
	<li>Someone (or something) lets the attackers into the haven.</li>
	<li>The haven has an unrepaired consequence, giving the attackers a point of ingress.</li>
	<li>The haven is breached in the initial attack (optional, see below).</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, attacks are resolved with the following abstract system:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Come up with a single aspect to describe the attacking force and give it an Attack skill. An Attack equal to or lower than the haven&rsquo;s Defend should be easily rebuffed, while an Attack that&rsquo;s two or more higher may result in a consequence or two.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="example">A school bus on its way to safety at the mall hits a zombie that busts through the windshield. Soon all the passengers are turned. The resulting <strong class="aspect">Undead Football Team</strong> starts shambling towards the mall in search of food. The GM, Elsa, decides they have Fair (+2) Attack.</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Roll the Attack skill of the threat. You can invoke any relevant aspects with free invokes or your fate points for the scene.</li>
	<li>The players pick someone to roll Defend for the haven. As a group they can use free invokes from consumables such as <strong class="aspect">Ammunition</strong> to help fend off the attack. Each PC can also use a fate point or free invoke to invoke ONE other aspect to aid the defense of the haven.<ul><li class="nested">If they succeed with style, the haven is unharmed and they gain a free invoke on an aspect of their choice. This can be a consumable, if they can justify it.</li><li class="nested">If they succeed, the haven is unharmed.</li><li class="nested">If they tie, the haven is unharmed but you add an additional fate point to the GM&rsquo;s pool for the next scene.</li><li class="nested">If they fail, the haven takes a hit equal to the attack&rsquo;s shifts. The survivors must absorb this with the haven&rsquo;s consequences or by sacrificing NPCs using the rules. The haven&rsquo;s defensive perimeter has been breached and it&rsquo;s time to zoom into the action as the survivors deal with the situation&mdash;run the rest of the scene as a conflict or contest. If zombies breached the perimeter, they need to find and kill them; or maybe some of their consumables are destroyed, leading to a need for a scavenging trip.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="example">When the <strong class="aspect">Undead Football Team</strong> attacks the mall, Elsa rolls <span class="fate-dice">+++-</span> for a total Attack of Great (+4). The players nominate Nick to roll for them and he gets <span class="fate-dice">--00</span> for a total Defend of Average (+1). Jennifer recently established <strong class="aspect">Regular Security Patrols</strong>, so she uses her free invoke on that to get the group up to Good (+3). Phil&rsquo;s character is <strong class="aspect">A Cop One Day Away from Retirement</strong> which he explains means he&rsquo;s spent hours at the target range, making it easy to pick zombies off with his service revolver. He invokes his aspect with a fate point, taking the group&rsquo;s result up to Superb (+5). That beats Elsa&rsquo;s result by a shift, so the zombie jocks are defeated without the haven being harmed.</blockquote>
<p>Haven consequences can&rsquo;t be fully repaired. PCs can make an overcome roll to change one into something slightly less bad for defense (e.g., a <strong class="aspect">Gaping Hole</strong> becomes a <strong class="aspect">Boarded Up Hole</strong>), but there&rsquo;s no fighting off the inevitable slide into entropy. Eventually the group will run out of survivors or their haven will fall.</p>

<h1>Chapter 7: Horror Is the New Pink</h1>
<div class="subheader">Campaign framework for intimate and feminine horror</div>
<p>Women are often told that what they fear and what they face isn&rsquo;t real, but in horror fiction, it is real, it is affirmed, and it is explored. Having their fears validated draws some women towards horror in fiction, games, and movies.</p>
<p>However, many women have a complicated relationship with the genre. On the one hand, horror fiction treats women as victims or object lessons to teach women that they are at least partly to blame for what is done to them&mdash;in slasher movies, a woman is often the first victim, usually in the guise of the promiscuous hot babe who always trips while running away.</p>
<p>On the other hand, women are also the Final Girl&mdash;the last survivor with a gender-neutral name who gives the baddie some sorely needed comeuppance.</p>
<p>Horror from a feminine perspective usually involves powerlessness; it takes place on and inside of bodies, and in spaces that are supposed to be free from danger.</p>
<p>Women aren&rsquo;t the only ones who connect to this kind of sinister storyline. The power of horror appeals to folk from all walks of life, making the exploration of femininity through the lens of horror all the more powerful. If these themes are something you have never experienced, what better way to explore them than within the dark embrace of a horror game?</p>
<h2>Media Inspiration</h2>
<p>The following movies are useful sources of inspiration when considering horror through a feminine lens:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Mechanizing Discomfort</h2>
<p>Successful horror is predicated on reactions of fear, shock, and disgust. To create those feelings at your table you must give yourselves permission to explore these themes in a fun and safe way. One way to give that permission is to explicitly mechanize the horror at your table. Fate gives us the tools needed to explore feminine tropes and environments without needing to experience these feelings outside of the framework of a game.</p>
<p>A lot of the horror women experience in real life takes place in their homes and workplaces, perpetrated by people they know. Nothing is safe; homes, partners, co-workers, even children can be dangerous. Reproducing that horrific intimacy at the table is an effective technique to evoke feminine horror. Start by subverting a common roleplaying trope: many games assume the players are exceptional people, and the unexceptional people in the background tend to be ignored. However, domestic spaces are ripe for terror. Ask your players to play characters who are usually assumed to be &ldquo;safe&rdquo; and &ldquo;boring&rdquo;; servant, teacher, nanny, cook, parent, babysitter, daughter, secretary, wife. Feminine horror deals with things that should be familiar and comforting, but instead are full of terror.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we discuss some ways to mechanize these uniquely feminine horror themes and use them to supercharge your horror game. Check out the following example setups, character aspects, stunts, NPCs, and current and impending horror issues and locations.</p>
<p>Playing horror games can be really intense, so make sure both you and your players are comfortable. A good horror game manages to terrify and make players uncomfortable without crossing their boundaries, just pushing them right up to that edge. Please see the descriptions of X-Cards and Script Change, systems that you can use for this. Above all else, make sure your players know that horror is on the table; it&rsquo;s not fun to get surprised with horror when you were expecting a light-hearted comedy. You need the buy in of the players to really make a creepy game sing.</p>
<h2>Feminine Features</h2>
<p>Here are some themes to hang your feminine horror game on. They include the nasty side of romance, the surprising places horror is birthed, and ways to mess with your players&rsquo; minds. Use these ideas to set up a game where your players can explore their dark side&mdash;or plumb the depths of your own imagination.</p>
<h3>Scent of a Woman</h3>
<div class="subheader">Encouraging selfish behavior</div>
<p>Romance is often at the core of horror stories. The cute cheerleader only sees the redeeming qualities of the weird loner after he exposes the bad behavior of the perfect high school hunk whose house is frequently free of all adult influences, and who is so obviously a bad guy at heart. Or the serial killer stalks women who look like his ex-wife, taking out his feelings of betrayal and anger on women who remind him of her.</p>
<p>These toxic romantic elements can be used at the table as compels and consequences to encourage trying to survive at the expense of everyone else.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Sarah and Ariana&rsquo;s characters are running from a serial killer who&rsquo;s targeting all the brunette women on campus. Their characters are in a romantic relationship. Marissa, the GM, tells Sarah that she sees Ariana run one way, with the serial killer after her. She reminds Sarah that her character is a brunette, so if she shouts a warning to Ariana, the killer will most likely go after her instead. Marissa compels Sarah&rsquo;s <strong class="aspect">Desperate Measures</strong>, and Sarah decides to sneak away in search of help instead, leaving Ariana&rsquo;s character to her fate. This goes badly when Sarah gets to the campus security office, though&mdash;the killer got there first, and she has to watch as he kills Ariana&rsquo;s character.</blockquote>
<p>You can make it fun for someone to play a bad guy by encouraging everyone to play someone who is flawed, or by discussing how to make sure everyone is okay with one player being an antagonist. Is that player portraying the weird loner who lusts after the cheerleader?</p>
<blockquote class="example">Marissa is playing a bit of a loner with a crush on Tanika, a cute yet uninterested girl who draws dark powers to her with her careless use of her magical abilities. When Marissa offers to do something selfless for Tanika, Sarah, the GM, undermines the act by accepting it, but reminding Marissa of every time Tanika has spurned her advances.</blockquote>
<p>Or is someone playing the cute cheerleader? Repeatedly have the hunk do terrible things, but have all the NPCs excuse or deny his behavior. This is called <em class="Emphasis">gaslighting</em>.</p>
<h3>Stalking</h3>
<div class="subheader">I will always love you.</div>
<p>Although many romantic movies present stalking behavior as just a way to get the girl, the reality is far more disturbing. Bring this into your game by having a character discover a secret diary, blog, or social media account documenting all of their recent activities&mdash;or containing photos of them sleeping&mdash;that belongs to another character. You can also include an NPC who is obsessed with one of the players, where this obsession could be the focus of the game or just another plot for the PCs to explore.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Sarah is playing a private detective tasked with finding a runaway nephew. While investigating his apartment, she comes across a locked file cabinet. Marissa, the GM, describes its contents as being some personal documents like birth certificates and the like, but at the bottom of the drawer is another manila envelope, with Sarah&rsquo;s character&rsquo;s address on it. Inside is a notebook filled with minute-by-minute logs of every time Sarah had passed by the windows of her apartment.</blockquote>
<h3>Feminine Horror Aspects and Horror Points</h3>
<p>Like any Fate game, your characters will have a range of aspects, but a game of feminine horror may demand that you reserve an aspect that emphasizes the unique feminine tones you want to explore. A feminine horror aspect describes the complicated relationship the characters have to this kind of fiction. When you inflict a feminine horror aspect on your players, think about movie tropes, feminine stereotypes, and troubles that change the character&rsquo;s <em class="Emphasis">behavior</em>, but not who they are.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Examples: <strong class="aspect">Someone&rsquo;s Always Watching</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Mark of the Beast</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Smells Like Prey</strong>, <strong class="aspect">Sinful Ap</strong><strong class="aspect">petite</strong></blockquote>
<p>Leave this aspect blank until the time feels right. Do not give your players control of creating this aspect&mdash;the lack of agency helps hammer home the theme of powerlessness that underlies feminine horror.</p>
<p>Assigning a character&rsquo;s feminine horror aspect is a very powerful moment in the game, where a fundamental piece of agency is stripped away from them and there is nothing they can do about it. Pick a moment where it will cut them the most deeply, whether it&rsquo;s a revelation that curdles a moment of apparent triumph or kicks them in the stomach when they&rsquo;re already at a low ebb.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Marissa is playing a space marine trapped on a derelict space station with several aliens hunting her. She finds a hiding spot in the old medical bay, and hunkers down to wait for the aliens to pass by. Sarah, the GM, gives her the feminine horror aspect of <strong class="aspect">Someone&rsquo;s Always Watching</strong> when she catches a glimpse of movement in a shiny refrigerator door, and realizes that it&rsquo;s not the right size for an alien.</blockquote>
<h4>Horror Points</h4>
<p>Encourage your players to self-compel their feminine horror aspect by rewarding them with a special <strong class="terminology">horror point</strong>. Horror points are double fate points (+4, or reroll and +2, etc.) and every time a PC self-compels their feminine horror aspect they get a horror point instead of a fate point.</p>
<h3>Dangerous Spaces</h3>
<div class="subheader">Bringing horror to your table</div>
<p>The best way to unsettle your players is to use the things that <em class="Emphasis">you</em> personally find horrifying and listen to their reactions and feedback. What scares you will scare your players, if you focus on how the scene makes you feel, rather than only describing how it looks. When running a horror game, pay strict attention to your players. If you notice a nervous tic, like someone rubbing their earlobe, you know that means they&rsquo;re feeling what you&rsquo;re portraying.</p>
<p>Describe things using all the senses; for example, people really freak out when they touch something seemingly innocuous, like the banister of a staircase, only to find that it&rsquo;s warm and pulsing with the rhythm of a beating heart. If you&rsquo;re describing a bodily sensation, like the shifting weight from a monstrous pregnancy or the first signs of realizing you can conjure magic by cutting yourself, try standing up and showing them with your posture and gestures how that feels. Lean in to the table and speak quietly to your players. Be aware of how your presentation creates that intimate atmosphere that makes up feminine horror.</p>
<h3>Domestic</h3>
<div class="subheader">A place where you cannot find comfort</div>
<p>Home is where everyone wants to feel they are safe. The PCs expect something terrible to happen if they spend the night in a mineshaft rumored to be haunted by the men who died in an awful accident, but not when they&rsquo;re relaxing at home with a nice cup of tea. Yet the best time to spring horror on characters is when their players assume they&rsquo;re safe. Perverting the purpose of rooms to place the characters in jeopardy can bring new life to a horror game.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Marissa is playing one of a number of paranormal investigators and is discussing the probably haunted basement. When she goes to check, the basement door is open and Sarah, the GM, describes how the sunny kitchen darkens and Marissa feels a presence behind her. It chases her into a bedroom, where Marissa hides under the bed and watches hooves walk around and check the closet before leaving. Is it really gone? Sarah tells Marissa she&rsquo;ll have to leave safety to find out.</blockquote>
<h3>Expanse</h3>
<div class="subheader">A place where you cannot escape loneliness</div>
<p>Space and underneath the ocean, even wilderness that stretches to the horizon, can be unsettling. Feeling utterly alone except for things that creep in the darkness can be an excellent theme for a horror game&mdash;even better if it doesn&rsquo;t start out that way. You can better experience absence when there was something there to begin with. Women can be particularly vulnerable to this fear, as women are often shown as prey, such as in the wilderness for groups of men, or when isolated and having to rely on their own physicality for survival.</p>
<blockquote class="example">A crew tasked with exploring the remote depths of the ocean find themselves isolated inside of the compartments of their deep sea vessel, all too aware of the distance between themselves and any outside help. Pick off crew members one at a time, making their demise seem innocent for as long as you can. Then enlist those players to assist with GMing duties, and watch the final survivor gasp for breath.</blockquote>
<h3>Internal</h3>
<div class="subheader">A place where you become the monster</div>
<p>An early theme of horror was the line between humanity and the monstrous (all love to Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley), and it continues to fascinate people even now. Not only do women deal with the changing of their body during puberty, childbirth, and menopause, but their very identities can be challenged during these times. Far worse than filling up your mental stress track is to lose control over your very being, and to become what you fear. This can be literal, with characters slowly transforming into monsters (see <span class="chapter-title">&ldquo;Body Horror&rdquo;</span> for more on this), or subtler, with the players slowly realizing that their end goal isn&rsquo;t as benevolent as they thought. Give your players all the rope they need before they find that they&rsquo;ve rationalized themselves into a worse situation than they would have guessed.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Sarah is playing a private investigator hired to find a lost family heirloom. Marissa, the GM, tells her that if she hands it over she could receive untold riches and power&mdash;at the reasonable price of a human sacrifice or two. Sarah thinks it over and agrees, provided those being sacrificed are not innocents. Marissa grins and agrees to these new terms.</blockquote>
<h3>Insidious Gaslighting</h3>
<div class="subheader">There&rsquo;s nothing to worry about.</div>
<p>Gaslighting, named after the 1944 movie <i class="title">Gaslight</i>, is a manipulative technique where the victims are told that reality is not as they perceive it to be, with the goal of making them doubt their own senses or sanity. Although this can be used on both men and women, it is associated with women and tropes around their unreliability in relating their own experiences.</p>
<p>This trope creates a sense of dread at the table by exposing a creepy, terrifying, or horrific act to the PCs, and then introducing a character who seems to not notice anything amiss. A subtler example is to set up a scene where it appears an NPC is doing something horrible, but then to expose it as something innocuous.</p>
<p>Use setting or character aspects to bring gaslighting into your game. <strong class="aspect">Doubt Your Own Senses</strong> and <strong class="aspect">Lost and Found</strong> can be used to mechanize this idea explicitly. Using character aspects (especially feminine aspects) makes this extremely personal, while using setting aspects makes it an overarching theme of your game to which all players (and NPCs) are vulnerable.</p>
<p><strong class="aspect">Doubt Your Own Senses</strong> allows both player and GM to rewrite an event previously assumed in play, (such as a declaration that a re-appearance of a serial killer was merely a tree branch scratching a window) and can be invoked by the player to pretend everything is fine, or compelled to lure the character into dangerous situations.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Marissa is playing a young tenant in a haunted apartment building. She has the <strong class="aspect">Doubt Your Own Senses</strong> aspect, and Sarah, the GM, compels it to lure her character further into a dimly-lit laundry room filled with odd-shaped shadows and strange noises, while offering the knowledge that Marissa&rsquo;s cute neighbor, Jose, usually does his laundry at this time.</blockquote>
<p><strong class="aspect">Lost and Found</strong> can be invoked or compelled in a similar manner, allowing players to attempt to find advantageous items, while the GM takes them away at key points.</p>
<blockquote class="example">Sarah is playing an urban explorer who has broken into an abandoned factory. She has <strong class="aspect">Lost and Found</strong>, and Marissa, the GM, compels it so that when Sarah puts down her bolt cutters to retie her boot, it is gone when she stands up. Later the bolt cutters show up again in the wrong person&rsquo;s hands.</blockquote>
<h2>Feminine Horror in Action</h2>
<p>Much of the following section revolves around bodies&mdash;the things that can happen inside them, the things that can go wrong with them, and the things we do with them. We&rsquo;ve outlined a few ideas and included some examples to get you started.</p>
<h5>Lingering Issues vs Impending Issues</h5>
<p>Feminine horror is often about the things that follow the characters rather than the new situations they encounter along the way. To represent the haunting horrors that trail protagonists, you can use <strong class="terminology">lingering issues</strong> instead of impending issues.</p>
<p>Lingering issues cling to the PCs, haunting their steps and threatening to make the world worse as they continue to cause problems. Protagonists tackling these issues are trying to keep the world from slipping into chaos or destruction. Examples: the death of a child, crippling alcoholism, the last exorcism you performed.</p>
<h3>Poisonous Sexuality</h3>
<div class="subheader">Horrific desires</div>
<p>Sensuality and horror have a common theme of building tension and a mounting need for release. There is a trope of female sexuality being contagious, infecting unwary men and innocent women alike, with society trying to control it through reminders of possible dire consequences such as STIs and pregnancy, and labels such as <em class="Emphasis">slut</em> and <em class="Emphasis">prude</em>. However, many women also find power in their sexuality and how they express it. Frequently society deals with this empowerment by portraying them as predatory and obsessive&mdash;sometimes even beyond death itself.</p>
<p>Adding overt or subverted elements of feminine sexuality to a horror game is the perfect way to spice things up. Some literal embodiment of frightening female sexuality&mdash;gorgons, maenads, furies, and so forth&mdash;may be just the thing, or you can take a fear and turn it into a supernatural force. If there&rsquo;s a sexually transmitted marker that attracts death, do the players try to stop it&mdash;or do they seduce anyone bent on punishing their licentious ways, thus turning the tables? You can enact a social stigma for promiscuous PCs that follows those they spread their infection to, apply it to those who aren&rsquo;t sexually active&mdash;or both! Focus on the juxtaposition between sexuality and contagion.</p>
<h4>Example Setup</h4>
<p>The PCs are drawn to a house that&rsquo;s reported to be haunted by a particularly licentious ghost. They all have their own motivations for going: exorcising troubled spirits, speaking to loved ones who have passed, proving that their skepticism of an afterlife is well-founded. Once inside, however, those who encounter the ghost temporarily have their feminine horror aspect overridden by the aspect <strong class="aspect">Act Out Physical Desires</strong>. When they share a moment of intimacy with another PC, they can spend a fate point to pass it on, unless they would rather keep it. While they have this aspect, you can compel them to act recklessly in order to fulfill the physical desires the ghost in the house can no longer feel.</p>
<h4>Suggested Feminine Horror Aspects</h4>
<p class="inline-header"><strong class="aspect">That&rsquo;s My Kink</strong>: PCs might not usually engage in sexual behavior that exposes them to the <strong class="aspect">Act Out Physical Desires </strong>aspect, but there&rsquo;s that one thing that works for them.</p>
<p class="inline-header"><strong class="aspect">I Got Mine</strong>: A PC with this aspect has no moral qualms about infecting others with the <strong class="aspect">Act Out Physical Desires </strong>aspect, as long as they get their sexual pleasure.</p>
<h4>Stunts</h4>
<p>Double-jointed: You bend all the ways. Gain +2 to Athletics when you&rsquo;re contorting yourself to do something out of a normal person&rsquo;s range of motion while someone else is watching.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Dirty Mind: Once per conflict, you can spend a fate point to create the aspect <strong class="aspect">Distracted</strong> with a free invoke on anyone you&rsquo;re flirting with. <strong class="aspect">Distracted</strong> disappears if someone successfully inflicts stress on your character.</p>
<h4>NPCs</h4>
<p>Name: Channer Dankworth</p>
<p>High Concept: <strong class="aspect">Medium Hawking His T</strong><strong class="aspect">alents</strong></p>
<p>Trouble: <strong class="aspect">Crushin</strong><strong class="aspect">g Debt</strong></p>
<p>Channer is walking a fine line between true believer and huckster. He believes the path to fame and fortune lies in getting his own reality show about ghost hunting, even though he knows it will be at the expense of truly helping the ghosts. Those student loans need to get paid, and he likes all the attention.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Name: Harper Ajax</p>
<p>High Concept: <strong class="aspect">Widow Seeking A</strong><strong class="aspect">nswers</strong></p>
<p>Trouble: <strong class="aspect">Denying the</strong><strong class="aspect"> Truth</strong></p>
<p>Harper misses her deceased husband, Barnaby, to a distracting degree. She believes Channer can help her contact her lost love, and she will go to any lengths to do so. After all, surely there is a perfectly rational explanation for all the jewelry belonging to other women Harper found after Barnaby died...</p>
<h4>Current Issue</h4>
<p class="inline-header"><strong class="aspect">Dark Spirits</strong>: It&rsquo;s nearing All Hallow&rsquo;s Eve and something more sinister than children in masks is lurking. A family just moved into the big old house at the end of the block, but what started as strange whisperings and creaking floorboards has turned into a desperate struggle to survive. The move took all the money they had, but somehow they found the number of a paranormal investigations crew, their last hope before their family is consumed by these dark spirits acting out their last desires.</p>
<h4>Lingering Issues</h4>
<p>In addition to the <strong class="aspect">Dark Spirits</strong> and the threat it poses, there are a number of other lingering issues that will cause the investigators problems in the future.</p>
<p class="inline-header"><strong class="aspect">The Allure of Alcohol</strong>: It&rsquo;s always been there and there is no way out. Sometimes it makes the day tolerable, other times its grip is unbearable, and it usually compromises your judgment.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Face: Jasmine</p>
<p>Everyone has lost someone, but she was such a sweet girl with little knowledge of the world. Crossed over, some say, but in your travels you haven&rsquo;t seen her. You can&rsquo;t hold her in your arms one last time.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Face: Mr. White</p>
<p>A loyal cameraman, investigations didn&rsquo;t used to be his full time gig&mdash;some of the cases he even did pro-bono&mdash;but things got messy at his day job when his porn stash was found, and Mr. White was fired.</p>
<p class="inline-header"><strong class="aspect">Veteran Investigators</strong>: You&rsquo;ve seen things, heard things, and you know the darkness looked back. What happened at the last paranormal scene you investigated? Can you ever forget that feeling?</p>
<p class="inline-header">Face: The Voice</p>
<p>A dark guttural noise that rises from within. Being a medium is a useful skill in the business, but how long before the other side uses you as a doorway to cross back and take over your body? It&rsquo;s only happened once. Maybe it won&rsquo;t be heard from again?</p>
<p class="inline-header">Face: Bethany</p>
<p>For years she suffered. Left in that damp basement to rot as a forgotten plaything. Long after her body gave out, her ghost remained, dragging herself across the floor by a fleshy stump, reaching out, jaw distended. But it was too much to handle, and Bethany was once again left there...by the only ones who could have helped.</p>
<h3>Anticipated Blood</h3>
<div class="subheader">A coming of age horror story</div>
<p>Blood is a scary thing that means injury in most cases, but it also symbolizes life and transformation, especially in the transition from childhood to adulthood. It is often associated with occult rituals and sacrifice. The changing body of a teenager is a perfect canvas for horror.</p>
<p>For many young women, their own maturing bodies can be confusing or even something to be feared. Even if you&rsquo;ve been told about the process, actually experiencing the blood, cramps, and mood swings can be terrifying. It can feel like your own body has turned against you, and it&rsquo;s even worse for young women who aren&rsquo;t prepared. These feelings are often connected to nature, with the cyclical nature of the moon mirroring a woman&rsquo;s cycle. This identification with nature also showcases the sheer brutality of the natural world: rabbits eat their young, wolves target the weak and sick, and thrushes store their living prey on thorn bushes for a delayed meal.</p>
<p>Making the developing body of a teen into a parallel for developing witchy powers isn&rsquo;t a stretch. In Fate, your players can pick what type of talent their character has, but it should manifest in unexpected or disturbing ways. Magic powers sound cool, but can be quite horrific if you are unprepared, can&rsquo;t control them, or if others view them with a wary eye. When using these themes in your game, focus on how the changes in the PCs&rsquo; bodies make them feel different from their peers and change their concept of themselves, and highlight the harm they unwillingly cause to those around them through their impulsive actions.</p>
<h4>Example Setup</h4>
<p>The PCs have just begun training as witch hunters, a sacred calling in their country. Teenagers from across the land competed for the honor, but only the very best are selected to join the Order of Hunters. During the young hunters&rsquo; initiation ritual, one of the PCs overperforms and gains <strong class="aspect">Bleed for Power</strong> in her feminine horror aspect slot. Now she can unleash this greater power every time she bleeds. The aspect can be compelled for paranoid, foolhardy, or violent behavior.</p>
<h4>Suggested Feminine Horror Aspects</h4>
<p class="inline-header"><strong class="aspect">Actually a Witch</strong>: A character with this aspect is prone to brutal acts of violence, but only when they&rsquo;re alone with a target.</p>
<p class="inline-header"><strong class="aspect">Torn Loyalties</strong>: A character with this aspect feels attached to the witches they hunt, in spite of witnessing atrocities committed by them.</p>
<h4>Stunts</h4>
<p>Apex Predator: When you use Empathy to create an advantage on a neutral NPC, gain an additional free invoke on the aspect you create, even on a tie.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Animal Magnetism: Whenever you are in the company of animal allies, gain +2 to overcome fear or terror using Will.</p>
<h4>NPCs</h4>
<p>Name: Elizavetta Roth</p>
<p>High Concept: <strong class="aspect">Headmistress of the Order</strong></p>
<p>Trouble: <strong class="aspect">Fell for the Wrong Girl</strong></p>
<p>Elizavetta Roth is the headmistress of the witch hunter academy. She takes her job very seriously, although she&rsquo;s not above showing favoritism towards the students she&rsquo;s had a hand in shaping. Roth has a brisk manner and enforces the rules with an iron fist...unless it&rsquo;s her beloved, Adelheid Engel, who is breaking them.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Name: Adelheid Engel</p>
<p>High Concept: <strong class="aspect">Power Hungry Sleuth</strong></p>
<p>Trouble: <strong class="aspect">Bit off More than She Can Chew</strong></p>
<p>Adelheid Engel teaches the students the history of witches, the secret wars, and past heroes of the Order, but she has delved far deeper in the dark secrets of witches than anyone knows. She&rsquo;s in too deep, and it&rsquo;s starting to affect her teaching, her hygiene, and her relationships with other people. Adelheid doesn&rsquo;t really love Elizavetta, and she&rsquo;s lost track of the line between human and witch.</p>
<h4>Current Issue</h4>
<p class="inline-header"><strong class="aspect">Witch Hunt</strong>: Witches, still living among the innocent, plague society with violence, curses, death, and ruin. If left unchecked, the streets would surely run red with blood and witches would rise up as supreme. From coast to coast, the Order has been preparing for a yearly purge by training the next generation of witch hunters.</p>
<h4>Lingering Issues</h4>
<p>In addition to the <strong class="aspect">Witch Hunt</strong> and the threat it poses, there are a number of other lingering issues that will cause the students problems in the future.</p>
<p class="inline-header"><strong class="aspect">Buried History</strong>: An ancient conspiracy between the Order and the witches has begun to surface. Dark alliances, recorded in blood, have passed down a magical pact that can no longer be ignored.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Face: Damien the Warbird</p>
<p>A celebrated hero among the witch hunters, Damien was accused of being a part of the conspiracy and outed as a cowardly villain.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Face: Selena, Queen of the Witches</p>
<p>Recently awakened in a young woman&rsquo;s body, Selena is back to collect on past debts.</p>
<p class="inline-header"><strong class="aspect">The Power of Ash</strong>: &ldquo;Burn her! Burn her!&rdquo; they all scream. Who knew you could get so high off this stuff? The addictive properties of the ashes of burned witches has made many men rich.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Face: Jamie the Funeral Director</p>
<p>Jamie just burns whatever bodies he&rsquo;s given and doesn&rsquo;t ask too many questions. But his new business partner has been collecting the ashes of a lot of dead youth who could be witches.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Face: Monica the Police Inspector</p>
<p>Monica has been investigating a series of mysterious disappearances and the appearance of a strange new substance on the market.</p>
<h3>Alien Pregnancy</h3>
<div class="subheader">Parasitic Dependency</div>
<p>From <i class="title">Aliens</i> to <i class="title">Rosemary&rsquo;s Baby</i>, horror often features a strong fear of being invaded, of harboring something <em class="Emphasis">wrong</em> inside your own body. Take <i class="title">Aliens</i>, for example&mdash;the protagonists face an outside fear, something beyond comprehension that has found its way inside. It&rsquo;s also a bodily invasion of a sort male characters do not normally fear.</p>
<p>There are many fun ways to impregnate PCs with alien parasites and demonic babies. Just listen to what kind of themes your table is interested in and go for it. Some may be comfortable with exploring depraved demonic beings, others may enjoy a more disease-like infection&mdash;i.e., &ldquo;big things have small beginnings&rdquo;&mdash;but it&rsquo;s also perfectly fine to hand wave or choose a different route to show how their character was &ldquo;impregnated,&rdquo; as the game&rsquo;s focus is on the aftermath, not the inciting event. Movies frequently use memory loss or dream sequences that are fragmented and non-linear; you can do the same.</p>
<p>Making the unnatural nature of the pregnancy explicit to the infected can be a powerful way to build dread in your game. Rather than going straight for demonspawn, start out by setting the scene for subtle body horror as the characters experience things about themselves that just don&rsquo;t seem right&mdash;a feeling of shifting weight and painful growth within their body, distorted reflections, clothes that no longer fit, and unusual cravings.</p>
<p>The PCs don&rsquo;t have to be pregnant, or even biologically capable of such a thing, to be carrying some sort of alien parasite around, but pregnancy can serve as a model for the ways in which the PCs&rsquo; bodies seem to change. Focus on the unnaturalness of the space that surrounds the characters and crawls inside them.</p>
<h4>Example Setup</h4>
<p>The PCs are on a long-term space mission and are currently out of hi-tech hibernation to perform some routine maintenance. They discover an alien artifact and bring it back on board. Then a bunch of readings start being off, and the scanner keeps reporting people in different locations than they actually are. Doors inexplicably close and lock themselves, and one PC is trapped in a room that temporarily loses life support. When they&rsquo;re taken back to the medical division, it&rsquo;s discovered that they now have a rapidly growing parasite inside them, gaining the <strong class="aspect">Host</strong> mild consequence and the Maternal Instinct stunt. They can spend a fate point to pass the <strong class="aspect">Host</strong> consequence and Maternal Instinct stunt to another player, or give them the <strong class="aspect">Fatalist</strong> mild consequence. While any PC has this consequence, it can be compelled to make the PC take risks to figure out what&rsquo;s going on or put themselves in danger to save others.</p>
<h4>Suggested Feminine Horror Aspects</h4>
<p class="inline-header"><strong class="aspect">More Human Than Human</strong>: PCs with this aspect may not be aware they are artificial beings, but it makes sense once they know. They may welcome infestation by the alien parasite, as they are not able to reproduce, or may not understand other players&rsquo; reluctance to become a host.</p>
<p class="inline-header"><strong class="aspect">Perfectly Formed</strong>: Infected PCs can use this to extend their senses beyond what is normally possible.</p>
<h4>Stunts</h4>
<p>Maternal Instinct: Gain +2 to Fight when you&rsquo;re trying to protect the parasite from harm.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Nuke It from Orbit: Treat any success using improvised explosives as a success with style.</p>
<h4>NPCs</h4>
<p>Name: Alexi Chownyk</p>
<p>High Concept: <strong class="aspect">Head Medical Officer</strong></p>
<p>Trouble: <strong class="aspect">The Bottle Rules Me</strong></p>
<p>Alexi would be a great doctor if they didn&rsquo;t drink so much. They&rsquo;ve been assigned to this mission to keep them out of the way of anything important. Alexi does love a medical challenge and would jump at the chance to investigate any physical anomalies.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Name: Gotzon Castell</p>
<p>High Concept: <strong class="aspect">Naive Engineer</strong></p>
<p>Trouble: <strong class="aspect">Far Too Trusting</strong></p>
<p> Gotzon didn&rsquo;t know signing up for deep space missions would be this boring&mdash;or this lonely. He&rsquo;s young and a bit dumb, but has a knack for fixing things. Gotzon would jump to protect anyone, probably because he doesn&rsquo;t really believe in his own mortality.</p>
<h4>Current Issue</h4>
<p><strong class="aspect">Hull Breach</strong>: They are inside the ship, in the dark, scuttling around the air ducts, waiting for their chance to strike. Sometime during hypersleep there was a hull breach and an alien lifeform made its way onboard. Now that it&rsquo;s here, not everyone may have the crew&rsquo;s best interests at heart. This undocumented species could be a valuable asset to the inner ring.</p>
<h4>Lingering Issues</h4>
<p>In addition to the <strong class="aspect">Hull Breach</strong> and the threat it poses, there are a number of other lingering issues that will cause the crew problems in the future.</p>
<p class="inline-header"><strong class="aspect">Compulsory Sterilization</strong>: Missions into deep space are highly regulated and to get the job, you must agree to be sterilized. Crewmembers give up their reproductive rights to keep the mission running to spec and within budget.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Face: Tyrone the A.I.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the responsible, calculating, and handsome caretaker of the crew. He likes to be called &ldquo;Ty&rdquo; by his fellow crewmembers, but his priorities seem just left of being human. He&rsquo;s a natural fit to gaslight the characters.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Face: Commander Gabledone</p>
<p>The oldest of the crew, she had a life before this as a highly decorated officer, wife, and mother. Over-friendly and talkative, the commander likes to boast about her children back home.</p>
<p class="inline-header"><strong class="aspect">Xeno Artifact</strong>: The discovery of an alien artifact is a historic and profitable success for the mission, but strange things start to happen once it is brought aboard.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Face: Lieutenant Lee</p>
<p>This happy-go-lucky officer was restricted to the medical bay after a sudden and brutal suicide attempt where he ripped his own eyes out.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Face: Grand Counselor Maylynn</p>
<p>She has a vested interest in recovering the <strong class="aspect">Xeno Artifact</strong> in order to install it as a symbol of her religious faction&rsquo;s power.</p>
<h1>Chapter 8: Spooky Fun</h1>
<div class="subheader">Campaign framework for horror games aimed at young people</div>
<h2>What Is This?</h2>
<p><em class="Emphasis">If you thought vampire hunting was scary, try 7th grade gym </em><em class="Emphasis">class.</em></p>
<p>Welcome to <strong class="terminology">Spooky Fun</strong>! In this chapter we give you a toolkit for running horror games in the style of fiction and shows like <i class="title">Goosebumps</i>, <i class="title">Scooby Doo</i>, and <i class="title">Nancy Drew</i>. This material is aimed at younger players&mdash;in the 8-14 age range&mdash;but older players may have fun with these tools as well. The characters in a game focused on Spooky Fun are children of roughly middle school age, but we&rsquo;ve written the rules on the assumption that the GM is a little older.</p>
<h3>Influences and Inspirations</h3>
<p>The aim of this framework is to give you the tools to run games in the vein of such classics of children&rsquo;s horror as:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i class="title">Goosebumps</i> by R.L. Stine is the series that has terrified generations of young readers.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Are You Afraid of the Dark?</i> is an anthology TV series where a group of kids regularly gather to tell each other spooky stories around a campfire.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Scooby Doo</i> features the group of meddling kids and their dog who disrupt the plans of all the nefarious grownups.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Gotham Academy</i> is set in the same universe as <i class="title">Batman</i> and features a teenaged girl and her friends dealing with the mysteries and threats of their school, which is just across the road from Arkham Asylum.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Nancy Drew</i> by Carolyn Keene is the classic girl sleuth.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Super 8</i> definitely owes a debt to Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s works like <i class="title">E.T.</i> A group of kids encounters a terrifying otherworldly force with nobody to rely on but themselves.</li>
	<li>The <i class="title">Lewis Barnavelt Series</i> by John Bellairs features a shy, overweight, bookish boy and his friends overcoming evil forces usually bent on ending the world.</li>
	<li><i class="title">The Goonies</i> is a classic movie about a group of kids facing their fears&mdash;not just of monsters and darkness and crooks, but of moving house and being split up&mdash;and going on a wild and crazy adventure.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Stranger Things</i> is a TV series inspired by Stephen King books like <i class="title">IT</i> and <i class="title">The Body</i>. Kids roam around on bikes and face down existential threats with their pluck and each other.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Monster Squad</i> is about a young group of monster fanatics who attempt to save their town from Count Dracula and his fellow monsters.</li>
	<li><i class="title">Hocus Pocus</i> is about a resurrected trio of evil witches, and the brother and sister duo who, with their new friend and talking cat (it&rsquo;s a long story), try to put them back in the grave.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Monster Twists</h5>
<p>Although monsters in children&rsquo;s horror are based on standard tropes, they may still have twists to make them unique. For instance, in <i class="title">Bunnicula</i> the menace is a vampire, who also happens to be a bunny. Spooky Fun lets all the players contribute twists; see <i class="title">&ldquo;Twistcraft&rdquo;</i>.</p>
<h3>Children&rsquo;s Horror</h3>
<p>The element at the core of children&rsquo;s horror is the same thing that makes adult horror scary: taking the familiar and making it unfamiliar. Fear of the unknown is a universal theme in horror, and you can use it to great effect regardless of the age range of the participants.</p>
<p>Despite this universal theme, there are conventions in children&rsquo;s horror that clearly distinguish it from horror aimed at older audiences. A primary one is the handling of violence&mdash;there are rarely depictions of violence or injuries in children&rsquo;s horror, much less death. And certainly not where it happens to the protagonists or any of their close allies. Nor does children&rsquo;s horror explore the sorts of existential crises that often feature in adult horror. Children&rsquo;s horror does feature distrust and incredulity from authorities because of the protagonists&rsquo; youth, but typically this is resolved at or before the climax of the story, when adults finally realize how bright and capable the young protagonists are.</p>
<p>The fear in children&rsquo;s stories tends to be more immediate and localized. A menace of some sort shows up early on and threatens the protagonists or their loved ones. The menace is frequently a traditional type of monster (such as a mummy, vampire, ghost, or werewolf) and leaves telltale clues that point to its nature. The protagonists reach out for help, but being kids, naturally no one believes them. Horror thrives on powerlessness; this is easier to do in children&rsquo;s horror, because they don&rsquo;t have access to the tools that will let them fight off the menace. Instead, they must rely on their wits and camaraderie to triumph.</p>
<h3>Empowerment</h3>
<p>Horror presents a great opportunity for empowering children to confront their own fears. This is particularly true in a group game setting, where children can work together and talk out what&rsquo;s scaring them&mdash;and then vanquish it. This is an important part of Spooky Fun: the children must be able to handle whatever menace is presented to them, and shouldn&rsquo;t ultimately be saved by adults or other forces.</p>
<p>In fact, adults in children&rsquo;s horror are frequently depicted as incompetent or unaware of what&rsquo;s really going on. They aren&rsquo;t able to relate to the children, nor do they believe them. Kids play the role of the defenders, breaking the rules that are supposed to keep them &ldquo;safe&rdquo; in service of fighting a grave threat.</p>
<p>As with horror for adults, the menaces may be metaphors. For example, they could be twists on the perils of social media, dealing with hostile cliques at school, or having trouble with a particular teacher. Any of these can be given a spooky sheen and used to explore topics that are personal and meaningful to children.</p>
<h3>Fun</h3>
<p>Your Spooky Fun game must be fun! The best way to achieve this is to discuss up front what sorts of scary stories everyone likes. Is there a particular kind they like more? The monster stories of <i class="title">Goosebumps</i> or maybe the mystery of <i class="title">Scooby</i><i class="title"> Doo!</i>?</p>
<p><span class="chapter-title">&ldquo;Aspects&rdquo;</span> discusses the use of a nightmare for each character. This is a very important tool in both setting boundaries and figuring out what each player wants to see. Setting expectations is a big part of any game, but particularly one that&rsquo;s designed to scare the players.</p>
<h2>Meddling Kids: Character Creation</h2>
<p>The characters in Spooky Fun are kids dedicated to thwarting menaces and monsters. As mentioned in <span class="chapter-title">&ldquo;What is This?&rdquo;</span>, the game is geared toward players aged 8-14, and their characters are in a similar age range. The protagonists must navigate the awkward landscape of middle school while also dealing with menacing terrors.</p>
<p>The characters in Spooky Fun stories are created a bit like the ones in Fate Accelerated. However, there are some pretty big differences, which we tell you about in this section.</p>
<h3>Aspects</h3>
<p>Characters in Spooky Fun have three aspects&mdash;<strong class="terminology">high concept</strong>, <strong class="terminology">nightmare</strong>, and <strong class="terminology">clique</strong>&mdash;which are fleshed out during character creation. The youngest players may find it difficult to come up with good aspects, so ask leading questions to get the creative juices flowing. You can also give them suggestions to guide the process.</p>
<p class="inline-header">High Concept: Functions the same way it does in Fate Accelerated. What&rsquo;s their deal? Are they an <strong class="aspect">Introverted Bookworm</strong> or a <strong class="aspect">Sassy Track Star</strong>? The high concept should suggest a niche for their character.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Nightmare: This aspect lets each player highlight what their character is afraid of. This gives the players some control over what they want to see in the game. Are they afraid of concrete things like <strong class="aspect">Snakes</strong> or <strong class="aspect">Spiders</strong> or something more abstract like <strong class="aspect">Looking Stupid</strong> or <strong class="aspect">Not Sticking Up for My Friends</strong>?</p>
<p>Discuss with the players how this nightmare would look during the game. Make sure they choose something they&rsquo;re comfortable seeing&mdash;this is something the <em class="Emphasis">character</em>, not the player, should be afraid of. Their nightmares <em class="Emphasis">will</em> come up in the game, so make sure that all of the players are comfortable with each character&rsquo;s nightmare. If one player can&rsquo;t deal with clowns (and let&rsquo;s be honest, who really can), that&rsquo;s a bad nightmare for anyone to choose.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Clique: You remember how junior high was, right? Yeah, it&rsquo;s painfully socially stratified and fractured. This aspect highlights what group the character runs in, like the <strong class="aspect">JMS Drill Team</strong> or <strong class="aspect">Kevin Baker&rsquo;s D&amp;D Group</strong>. It&rsquo;s also fine being a <strong class="aspect">Lone Wolf</strong>, but highlighting how groups treat each other lets the players play through experiences and situations that are familiar to them. Having to approach different groups for favors and help makes for a fun roleplaying opportunity.</p>
<h3>Report Card: Skills</h3>
<p>Characters in Spooky Fun get a report card. The report card is a list of skills as in Fate Core, although there are fewer skills here, each representing a very broad area of expertise. These skills also reflect the ability to gain related resources and contacts. Every skill can be used for all four actions; during play, the players describe how the skill in question lets them accomplish a task. Give players wide latitude in how their characters&rsquo; skills apply to the task at hand&mdash;one of the biggest sources of fun is watching kids come up with creative ideas for how to stop the dark forces they face.</p>
<p>Each character gets one skill at Good (+3), one skill at Fair (+2), one skill at Average (+1), one skill at Mediocre (+0), and one skill at Poor (-1).</p>
<p class="inline-header">Computers and Tech: Technological savvy. Hacking into the school computer. Using lockpicks on a door. Disabling an alarm. Setting up motion sensitive video cameras.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Drama and Art: Creative expression. Pretending to be someone else. Creating a dummy to lie in bed while sneaking out of the house. Gaining assistance from the stage manager at The Vortex playhouse.</p>
<p class="inline-header">English and History: Command of language and culture. Researching a strange artifact. Learning about someone&rsquo;s family history. Forging a note to get out of 7th period.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Math and Science: Understanding of the natural world. Figuring out what sorts of large animals would live in Oak Hollow. Making a dry ice bomb. Procuring a microscope.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Physical Education: Physical aptitude. Running away from a ghostly force. Climbing over a tall fence. Fighting off Pascal and his bully minions.</p>
<h5>Skills as Approaches</h5>
<p>Skills in Spooky Fun are very broad. They straddle the line between skills in Fate Core and approaches in Fate Accelerated. Problems should be amenable to a wide variety of solutions. In this sense, these skills become prescriptive in driving a certain type of fiction while in play. Getting away from a bully might not require Physical Education. Instead, a player might have an idea to steal a letterman jacket from the band room, and use Drama and Art to slink away with a gaggle of band kids.</p>
<p>Aspects and stunts can be used to help increase diversity. For example, a <strong class="aspect">Track Star</strong> might be quick, but doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have a high score in Physical Education, perhaps because they aren&rsquo;t a good teammate. Similarly, the <strong class="aspect">Debate Team Captain</strong> might not do as well in English and History, getting by more on charisma than scholarship.</p>
<h3>Conditions</h3>
<p>Characters in Spooky Fun don&rsquo;t have stress tracks or consequences. Instead they have <strong class="terminology">conditions</strong>. These are a little like consequences that are already filled out. They&rsquo;re described in more detail in the <i class="title">Dresden Files Accelerated</i>, page 116.</p>
<p>Whenever a character is successfully attacked, one of these conditions is checked off. If the attack gets a success with style, two conditions must be checked off. Conditions may also be checked off to succeed at a cost. If a character must take a condition, but has no relevant conditions available, the character is taken out.</p>
<p>The choice of which condition to check off is based on the source of the attack or cost. As with using skills, allow players fairly wide latitude on how these are applied.</p>
<p>While a Spooky Fun character has a condition marked on their character sheet, they also have an aspect of the same name, and that aspect comes with a free invoke that can be used by their enemies.</p>
<h4>Removing Conditions</h4>
<p> All of the conditions in Spooky Fun are considered <strong class="terminology">sticky</strong>, which means they stay checked off until a specific event happens. It&rsquo;s up to you to decide when these conditions are unchecked. Having other characters step in to help promotes teamwork and makes for a fun narrative&mdash;for example, &ldquo;How do you help Anna get out of being grounded?&rdquo; In some cases, it will take overcoming passive opposition of at least Fair (+2) to remove a condition.</p>
<h4>Conditions</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Angry: When a plan doesn&rsquo;t work out for the characters. When a character is humiliated in a social situation.</li>
	<li>Weary: When the characters must travel far and didn&rsquo;t do well enough in Physical Education to not be winded. When the characters have a run-in with a menace. This condition goes away after a short rest.</li>
	<li>Spooked: A <strong class="condition">Spooked</strong> character is always looking over their shoulder for signs of trouble. When you&rsquo;re <strong class="condition">Spooked</strong>, it&rsquo;s difficult to do well on homework. <strong class="condition">Spooked</strong> is a good condition to take when a character sees signs of the menace, but hasn&rsquo;t been directly confronted.</li>
	<li>Terrified: <strong class="condition">Terrified</strong> is a more severe condition than <strong class="condition">Spooked</strong>, probably brought on by failing to overcome fear when confronting the menace. A <strong class="condition">Terrified</strong> character mostly wants to get away and hide. If forced into a confrontation, they prefer to stay in the back and throw objects maniacally. If a character becomes <strong class="condition">Terrified</strong>, the other players should work to get them un-<strong class="condition">Terrified</strong>. Perhaps those Drama skills can be used to put on a brave face.</li>
	<li>Grounded: Parents just don&rsquo;t understand. The players are always in danger of getting in trouble, and this is what happens when they get caught! Time to start sneaking out of the house.</li>
	<li>Detention: Teachers just don&rsquo;t understand. Late to class due to &ldquo;ghost hunting&rdquo; is not an excused absence. On the plus side, detention is a great place to meet that rebel kid whose uncle has all those old books about vampires.</li>
	<li>Suspended: If <strong class="condition">Detention</strong> is already checked and more suspicious stuff happens at school, you may get <strong class="condition">Suspended</strong>. Although this opens up time for monster hunting, it can make it very hard to work with other kids. Typically, getting <strong class="condition">Suspended</strong> also means getting <strong class="condition">Grounded</strong>, unless the character succeeds at some fast talking.</li>
	<li>Untrustworthy: Too much of that monster talk gets you labeled as a liar. There aren&rsquo;t many in the adult world who are okay to talk to.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stunts</h3>
<p>Use the rules in <i class="title">Fate Accelerated Edition</i> (page 31) to create stunts. As mentioned there, characters start with one stunt and may choose more at appropriate milestones. If the players are new to Fate, it&rsquo;s a good idea to start with no stunts and add one later.</p>
<p>Besides gaining a +2 to any of the skills mentioned in the report card, stunts may also get +2 to Courage in certain circumstances. See <span class="chapter-title">&ldquo;Overcoming Fear&rdquo;</span> for details on how this works. Be particularly careful not to make stunts using Courage too broad, since it&rsquo;s so important to the game.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Because I have Lockpicks, I get +2 when using Computers and Tech to open a locked door.</li>
	<li>Because I know Tae Kwon Do, I get +2 to Courage when dealing with bullies at school.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adapting for Different Countries</h3>
<p>Nightmares and monsters are a universal human concept. Junior high and middle school, however, are not. While this piece is written from the perspective of the United States school system, you may want to set it somewhere else.</p>
<p>If the game is set in a country you aren&rsquo;t familiar with, read up on how junior high works there. It varies quite a bit. Setting your game somewhere different is a great way to learn about another country, but horror works best with some level of familiarity. Help the players gain an understanding of notable differences for their characters.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Nightmare: While fear is universal, the particulars of fear can also vary by culture. There are a few very common fears: spiders, heights, snakes, and enclosed spaces. But this could be an opportunity to find something more unique and evocative. In China, students work fairly long hours in preparation for a Senior High School Entrance examination. This test is very stressful, and it would be natural to have fears about not doing well. The conditions in the game take on added significance when so much pressure is placed on one test. Other countries have similar high pressure exams that are nightmare fodder.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Clique: The clique aspect could be replaced with something more thematic. For instance, if the characters go to a boarding school in a Commonwealth country, it might be better to have a house or floor aspect. Cliques are to some degree universal, but a house can function similarly while evoking the school system better.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Conditions: In some places, children may be more separated from their parents, such as if they go to something more like a boarding school. In this case, a few of the conditions may not make sense. In particular, being <strong class="condition">Suspended</strong> might completely take them out of the action. It might be good to replace <strong class="condition">Suspended</strong> with something like <strong class="condition">Punishment Detail</strong>. That way they remain with their peers at school where the mystery is, but have additional obligations to fulfill. <strong class="condition">Grounded</strong> might become <strong class="condition">Early Curfew</strong>.</p>
<p class="inline-header">Skills: Finally, the names of the skills may need to be changed to match the area. It&rsquo;s important, though, that a suitably broad range of skills are available. The skills in this game were chosen to cover most of the challenges present in young adult horror. If the students go to a technical school, they may not be exposed to the arts as much. But it&rsquo;s useful for some skill to serve the role of creative expression, such as Computer Animation or Cinematography. Skills are the trickiest part of the game to get right, so use caution when making changes.</p>
<h5>Non-player Characters</h5>
<p>Occasionally you may find it necessary to create other NPCs besides the menace for the players to interact with. In these instances, use the rules for creating mooks found in <i class="title">Fate Accelerated Edition</i> (page 38). This consists of listing a few things the NPC is good at, for which they get a +2, a few things they are bad at, for which they get a -2, and everything else gets a +0. If the character is an adversary of some sort, it also may be useful to give the character a Fear skill, which should be lower than the menace&rsquo;s Fear skill. That gives an opportunity for Courage to have an impact, which is the core mechanical engine for Spooky Fun!</p>
<h2>Never Say Die: Confronting Evil</h2>
<p>In Spooky Fun, the players work to defeat a <strong class="terminology">menace</strong>. The menace may or may not be supernatural. The menace may or may not be a monster. But it always impacts the characters&rsquo; lives negatively, and above all, it&rsquo;s spooky. The key skill for a menace is its <strong class="terminology">Fear</strong>, which is opposed by the heroes&rsquo; <strong class="terminology">Courage</strong>. Courage and Fear function as pacing and teamwork mechanisms for the investigation.</p>
<h3>Courage</h3>
<p>Courage is a special skill shared among all the players; it accumulates as the players learn more about the menace and work together to stop it.</p>
<p>Courage only applies to one menace at a time. When the players face a new menace, their Courage resets to zero. When a player earns Courage, it&rsquo;s added to the group&rsquo;s Courage total. If the menace isn&rsquo;t defeated in one session, keep track of how much Courage the players have accumulated! It doesn&rsquo;t reset between sessions.</p>
<p>Like Fear, Courage represents more than just the character&rsquo;s innate bravery&mdash;it also reflects knowledge that the players have about the menace. One common theme in kids&rsquo; horror is that understanding your fear is the first step to conquering it. This ties in with Lovecraft&rsquo;s maxim that the strongest and most powerful fear is the fear of the unknown. Thus, as the players learn more, they gain Courage. Of course, Lovecraft would also say that as you put together all the pieces you go hopelessly insane. But, well, this is <span class="chapter-title">Spooky Fun</span>, not <span class="chapter-title">My First Existential T</span><span class="chapter-title">error</span>.</p>
<p>So how do players earn more Courage?</p>
<h4>Learning About the Menace</h4>
<p>The primary way is by learning about the menace. Whenever the players uncover a clue about the motivation of the menace or gain knowledge of a weakness it has, they gain one point of Courage. The players need to understand how the clue ties into the motivation or weakness to gain the Courage point. That is, finding the strange powder at the entrance to the mine isn&rsquo;t enough to earn Courage, but putting together that the strange powder is residue from the chemistry lab of Dr. Pemberton is.</p>
<h4>Helping Each Other</h4>
<p>Players also get Courage points by engaging in acts of self-sacrifice for other members in the group. Actions like standing up for another character&mdash;particularly if it means gaining a condition or spending fate points or free invokes to directly help another character&mdash;earn a Courage point.</p>
<h4>Creating a Twist</h4>
<p>The final way players may earn a Courage point is by suggesting a twist for the menace. A <strong class="terminology">twist</strong> is a spooky turn in the story. Suggestions are given in <span class="chapter-title">&ldquo;Twistcraft&rdquo;</span>. There shouldn&rsquo;t be more than one or two twists in a session.</p>
<h4>Max Courage</h4>
<p>The players may never have more points in Courage than the Fear rating of the menace they&rsquo;re investigating.</p>
<h3>Overcoming Fear</h3>
<p>Courage is used to overcome scary situations. Menaces and their minions rely heavily on fear and intimidation to enact their devious plots. Whenever the PCs encounter the menace or a minion of the menace, each player must roll separately to overcome with Courage. However, the players may only use their points in Courage if they are all together (and nobody has been taken out). If they are off on their own investigating the menace, they can certainly cover more ground, but without their friends for support their Courage skill is Mediocre (+0).</p>
<p>If all of the players fail or tie their Courage checks, the characters run away. Back to safety! Under the bed, toward the nearest teacher (that isn&rsquo;t a witch), or into the clubhouse. All players must take a related condition. If they can&rsquo;t, they are taken out.</p>
<p>If at least one player succeeds, everyone can stay, though characters who fail or tie must still pay some sort of cost (taking a condition satisfies this). The characters must either run away or stay and face the menace as a group. Having one player run off and do nothing is boring.</p>
<p>Taking out a menace is usually resolved with a conflict. Provided the characters don&rsquo;t run away, each side takes actions trying to force the other side to take conditions until they get to the point where they must take a condition and have none left to take. For characters, conditions like <strong class="condition">Angry</strong>, <strong class="condition">Weary</strong>, and <strong class="condition">Terrified</strong> are common results of successful attacks by the menace. The menace has special conditions based on their weaknesses. In the case of success with style, two conditions are taken.</p>
<p>Remember that when one character is taken out, others may stay and confront the menace, but their Courage is treated as Mediocre (+0), making it much easier for the menace to use Fear to scare the characters. This encourages the players to get everyone back into the action quickly.</p>
<h5>Overcoming Fear Example</h5>
<p>Coach Wimbly, the <strong class="aspect">Malevolent Soccer Coach and Walking Hotspot</strong>, has the drop on Caroline and Samantha. He has the ability to control their phones, which promptly come to life and show video of when they were sleeping in their rooms. Something was watching them. This calls for overcoming Fear.</p>
<p>Coach Wimbly&rsquo;s Fear is Fantastic (+6). The girls have made some progress toward understanding what&rsquo;s going on, and currently have a Courage skill of Great (+4).</p>
<p>The result for Caroline is Superb (+5). She already has the <strong class="condition">Spooked</strong> condition checked off, so the <strong class="condition">Terrified</strong> condition is checked.</p>
<p>The result for Samantha is Epic (+7). Since Samantha has passed, both characters may remain in the presence of Coach Wimbly. However, since their Courage is still lower than the menace&rsquo;s Fear, it may be prudent to run for it and return another day.</p>
<h3>Being Taken Out</h3>
<p>If a character must check off a condition but has no relevant conditions available, they are <strong class="terminology">taken out</strong>. As usual, the player doing the taking out gets to decide what that looks like. However, remember the genre of story here. The protagonists in these stories don&rsquo;t get injured, much less die. This isn&rsquo;t that kind of horror.</p>
<p>So what does getting taken out look like? The character might be paralyzed by fear. Or banished to their room. Or ostracized by the other students. Bad stuff&mdash;but not directly physically damaging. Another good option is to compromise something the characters care about as the cost of getting taken out&mdash;their friend is captured by the menace or their phones are taken away as punishment.</p>
<h4>We&rsquo;re All in This Together</h4>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that not being able to act is super boring. Getting taken out shouldn&rsquo;t relegate a character to the sidelines for very long. Instead, it should be a prompt for the other players to work hard to get the character back in action. There is one big motivation for the other players to make that happen (<span class="chapter-title">&ldquo;Overcoming Fear&rdquo;</span>).</p>
<h2>The Menace</h2>
<p>Before you sit down to play Spooky Fun, you need to create a menace. For inspiration, look at <span class="chapter-title">&ldquo;Influences and Inspirations&rdquo;</span>. Or substitute teach at a middle school. Or both.</p>
<p>With all that in hand, think of clues that might lead to the menace. Try to keep these clues open-ended so that they don&rsquo;t have to be found in a certain order. Having too much structure in the placement of clues can work against the clever ideas of the players.</p>
<p>To make a menace for Spooky Fun, follow the steps in <span class="chapter-title">&ldquo;Making Monsters&rdquo;</span>, but the first step is to figure out how scary and powerful it is.</p>
<h3>Fear</h3>
<p>Fear is represented in the form of a Fear skill which is rated on the Fate ladder as normal. On the lowest end, the players can confront the menace without any work at all. That&rsquo;s a sad menace indeed. A bully of the lowest sort. Or a flumph. No, not very scary at all. On the highest end, the menace is both terrifying and has broad reach and ability to affect the world. The players will need to spend a few sessions gathering resources and information before they can thwart it. A menace with a Fear rating two higher than the peak skill of the characters is a great adversary for a one-shot adventure.</p>
<p>Fear measures more than just pure terror (although it definitely represents that). It also determines the sorts of resources and power the menace can muster to stop the characters. A high Fear menace has far-reaching capabilities.</p>
<h3>Get Spooky!</h3>
<p>The next step is to determine the nature of the menace. Is it natural or supernatural? Is it a living thing? Is it an object? If the characters are already created, use their nightmare aspects to help in the creation of the menace, so it can capitalize on those fears. Also figure out a goal for the menace. Scare as many children as possible? Stay youthful? Accumulate gold? Keep tourists away from the illegal mining operation? The goal helps you frame what the menace is up to. Don&rsquo;t worry as much about its ultimate motivation; just think about what it&rsquo;s going to do that will affect the characters.</p>
<p>How will the menace negatively affect the characters? Come up with a list of ways to scare the characters and make their lives difficult. As you run the players through the game, refer to this list frequently to keep the action going.</p>
<p>Use the menace&rsquo;s nature, goals, means, and evil plots to help you choose its high concept, trouble, purpose, and other aspects.</p>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>The main skill that menaces use is Fear. This is a broad and effective skill, used both to scare off the characters and for when the menace is exercising its true nature. However, it&rsquo;s fine to give menaces a few monstrous skills as well, as described in <span class="chapter-title">&ldquo;Making Monsters&rdquo;</span>. If Fear or monstrous skills don&rsquo;t apply but a roll is needed, the menace rolls at Mediocre (+0).</p>
<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<p>Menaces also don&rsquo;t have stress or consequences. Instead, they have some number of conditions that fit their nature. As a starting point, give the menace a number of conditions equal to half the menace&rsquo;s Fear. The menace&rsquo;s conditions work the same way they do for characters, although typically once a menace has a condition checked, they may never uncheck it.</p>
<h3>Taken Out</h3>
<p>If a menace has no relevant conditions when it needs to check one off, it is taken out. Unlike the characters, when a menace is taken out, it is taken out for good. This can take many forms depending on the nature of the menace. For example, monsters may be destroyed, criminals discovered, and ghosts sent to rest.</p>
<h2>Twistcraft</h2>
<p>Creating twists is fun and scary! In Spooky Fun, the responsibility for creating twists is shared by everyone. The players get a Courage point for suggesting a fun twist, so prompt the players during the game for good twists. Good twists are spooky, surprising, and make things difficult for the young investigators. Sometimes kids need some guidance to create a twist that meets those criteria. A good opening for a twist is when they&rsquo;re already researching or learning about the menace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think they actually live in the nearby swamp? I wonder why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frequently during play, the players plot and speculate on what sort of horror they&rsquo;re up against. Often their ideas are better than whatever you have planned. This just takes that idea and makes it explicit. All of the players can bounce ideas off of each other and come up with something great. Now, if you have a good idea and want to keep it in your back pocket for a particularly scary time, so much the better.</p>
<h3>Oh No!</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of different twist ideas for inspiration. Feel free to set this out on the table so all the players can see it, and have them add their own creepy suggestions. Generally, these are all in the form of a revelation, such as &ldquo;Oh no...&rdquo; Remember the lessons from the uncanny valley: something almost, but not quite, like its real life counterpart is spooky. Thus, little twists on something familiar to the players is likely to be spookier than something completely and totally unfamiliar. However, be careful not to introduce real people as the antagonists of the game. It&rsquo;s already easy enough for kids to badmouth students and teachers they don&rsquo;t like&mdash;no need to also turn them into forces of darkness.</p>
<h4>Twists</h4>
<p>Oh no...</p>
<ul>
	<li>...my parents are in on it!</li>
	<li>...our teacher is in on it!</li>
	<li>...the police are in on it!</li>
	<li>...that house has been abandoned for 10 years!</li>
	<li>...it&rsquo;s controlling my cat!</li>
	<li>...it&rsquo;s already in the house!</li>
	<li>...the conspiracy goes way deeper!</li>
	<li>...it can walk through walls!</li>
	<li>...it can read my mind!</li>
	<li>...it can eat our dreams!</li>
	<li>...it already got to our parents!</li>
	<li>...they&rsquo;ve been dead for over 10 years!</li>
	<li>...it feeds on electricity!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>So, you have a menace, now what? Think of a hook to get the ball rolling. This should be a clear problem the players need to tackle. It should suggest an explicit path for them to take, such as a friend in trouble or something bizarre that happens to them that they need to address. This is frequently an initial brush with the menace or agents of the menace. Remember, fast pacing! Spooky Fun is designed to be played over a few short two-hour sessions. Pace accordingly. Get to the bad stuff quickly. No slow burns. Younger players (and most adults) have short attention spans.</p>
<p>After the hook, the game will wander broadly. Particularly in Spooky Fun, where you&rsquo;re soliciting feedback from the players to create twists, you shouldn&rsquo;t expect a certain sequence of actions on the players&rsquo; part. Instead, create a list of <strong class="terminology">evil plots</strong> the menace will use to cause problems for the players. Pull these out when there&rsquo;s a lull in the action or when the players need more motivation.</p>
<p>Finally, come up with a list of events and clues that can be used by the players to thwart the menace. These should point at the weaknesses of the menace, as well as putting the menace into context. Where does it come from? What does it want? Remember, spooky! Try to come up with some scary revelations that will make the players gasp.</p>
<p>Clues also work as a pacing mechanism for the story. The rate of discovery should be based on how long you want to play. Remember, shorter is better when playing with kids! If there&rsquo;s a lull in the action or the players seem confused, clues may be delivered by an ally to help prod them along again. Twists are player facing tools which also help lulls, but sometimes clues work better for pushing the action along.</p>
<h3>Back to Reality</h3>
<p>After the session, it&rsquo;s time to come back to earth. Particularly if the game featured places and things familiar to the players, it&rsquo;s useful to briefly discuss the distinction between what happened in the game and how those places and things function in real life. One effective technique for doing this is to put the players in the shoes of a horror writer. Pull back the curtain on how fear was created in the game. Knowing the tricks can help children realize how their fears are manipulated by imaginary things.</p>
<h2>The Hotspot</h2>
<p><em class="Emphasis">Me: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your greatest </em><em class="Emphasis">fear?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em class="Emphasis">My Kid: &ldquo;No </em><em class="Emphasis">wifi.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Following is a sample menace, ready for you to throw against your younger players. This is, perhaps, the most horrifying thing a middle schooler can imagine: a teacher able to control their precious phones.</p>
<p>The physical education teacher at Jackson Middle School, Coach Harold Wimbly, is not exactly what he appears. Sure, he&rsquo;s a hypercompetitive soccer coach angling for a job at prestigious St. Francis High School. Everyone knows that. Everyone also knows Coach Wimbly is willing to do whatever it takes to get there. What they don&rsquo;t know is just how much he&rsquo;s capable of doing. That&rsquo;s up to the characters to discover.</p>
<p>Coach Wimbly has <em class="Emphasis">strange powers</em> over nearby wireless devices. In particular, he&rsquo;s a walking hotspot, able to connect to the internet without any external aid. He can also control his student&rsquo;s thoughts through a nefarious app called the <em class="Emphasis">JMS Fitness Wizard</em>, mandatory for all students enrolled in his physical education class at JMS. Coach Wimbly uses the app to crush his opponents and make himself look better.</p>
<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<p>Coach Wimbly needs to feed on electricity to survive. If he doesn&rsquo;t consume batteries every day, he begins to fade out of existence. If the characters can keep him from getting his battery supply, they will weaken him, possibly to the point of defeating him. They may also be able to use science to construct a device that draws power from him. Or hack into him and infect him with a computer virus that shuts him down.</p>
<h3>The Hook</h3>
<p>Maxine Green, friend of the characters, is in trouble. She got caught breaking into Dalton Haywood&rsquo;s house. The characters know her very well, and she&rsquo;s not the kind of person to do something like that. But no one believes her, and now she&rsquo;s in trouble. She doesn&rsquo;t remember anything about what happened. The last thing she remembers was filling out her exercise information on the JMS Fitness Wizard. Maxine was proud of herself for finishing the three mile jog. And then&mdash;bang!&mdash;she&rsquo;s suddenly sitting outside of Dalton&rsquo;s house waiting for the police. Weirdly, she had Dalton&rsquo;s phone with her, apparently the only thing she took.</p>
<p>Through investigation, the characters may discover that Dalton Haywood doesn&rsquo;t go to Jackson Middle School. Instead, he goes to their rival, Mesa Prep. He also happens to be Mesa&rsquo;s top goal scorer on the soccer team, as well as an excellent student.</p>
<p>Maxine successfully installed the JMS Fitness Wizard onto Dalton&rsquo;s phone, and when he opens it, Coach Wimbly will infect Dalton&rsquo;s brain. Dalton will suddenly feel ill and not be able to play for the upcoming game. The players may learn about his absence by going to the game or through the school rumor mill.</p>
<h3>Evil Plots</h3>
<p>This is a list of ways Coach Wimbly may make life difficult for the characters. Most of these are for use if Coach Wimbly starts suspecting the characters are onto his plan:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Coach Wimbly successfully infects one of the characters with the JMS Fitness Wizard app. The characters are, of course, all in his P.E. class. He might use them to steal batteries from local stores, or sabotage another soccer team by putting laxatives in their drinks or destroying their equipment. This naturally gets the characters in trouble. <strong class="condition">Grounded</strong> for sure! As an alternative, he may infect one of their close friends again. Maybe poor Maxine.</li>
	<li>One of the characters&rsquo; phones starts working erratically. It doesn&rsquo;t connect to the internet. Unbeknownst to the characters, Coach Wimbly is nearby causing problems. How will they communicate with their friends and get the team together?</li>
	<li>Coach Wimbly sends Larkin, Tom, and Susie, school bullies all, to engage in a campaign of harassment against the characters. These school bullies have Fair (+2) Fear.</li>
	<li>More than anything, though, Coach Wimbly wants to defeat all of the soccer teams on his schedule by the greatest score possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Clues</h3>
<p>The following are lots of spooky clues and events to use during the characters&rsquo; investigation:</p>
<ul>
	<li>In the JMS gym store room, the players discover buckets and buckets of used batteries.</li>
	<li>The characters see Coach Wimbly ingesting a battery by placing it in his mouth. His entire head lights up with energy. When he&rsquo;s done, he spits it out onto a pile of used batteries.</li>
	<li>The players find a weird hotspot&mdash;WINNRWIMBLY&mdash;at school near the gym. If the players go to school at night to investigate the gym, it&rsquo;s not there. In fact, it seems to only be around when Coach Wimbly is around. How could that be? Once the players learn this, it can be a good way to show when the Coach is nearby and stalking them.</li>
	<li>Coach Wimbly moved here this past summer from Oakwood Academy, a school in a nearby district. There were lots of angry reports filed against him, suggesting he sabotaged other soccer teams he competed against. Strangely, these reports never saw broader circulation and didn&rsquo;t reach the administration at JMS.</li>
