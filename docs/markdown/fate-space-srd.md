# Introduction

_A space-suited ship’s marine wielding a scatter-laser scrambles out of an airlock onto the hull of a spaceship, his magboots activated, and opens fire on the boarding-droids trying to break into the ship...a starfighter pilot is pushed back into the contours of her acceleration couch as her sleek attack boat zooms from the mother ship’s launch bay, incoming bogies reading as a swarm of hot red blips laser-painted on her retinas...a thick-waisted human merchant and his alien guide push through the press of a crowded bazaar under skies far from Earth as a blue-skinned shopkeeper with a mane of multicolored fronds seeks to entice them with the glowing green orb that floats above the dactyls of his splayed-out hand..._

Welcome to the _Fate Space Toolkit_! This book is for players and GM who want to create Fate games focused on _science fiction space adventure_. Science fiction is a gigantic genre, and though we’ll focus on just adventures in outer space, we’ve still got to cover a vast expanse, so we’re going to get to the heart of things as quickly as we can. We’ll talk about how to use the Fate system to run science fiction campaigns set in space, and we’ll provide a range of options for including space travel and space battles as well as alien worlds and alien cultures in your game. We’ll tackle the question of realism from multiple angles in order to provide as wide a variety of approaches to space adventure as we can, from gritty Apollo-era techno-thriller to cerebral far-future space opera.

And the possibilities are endless! Think about the ways that outer space is used in science fiction. It can be a frontier for exploration, a source of “infinite diversity in infinite combinations,” (as in _Star Trek_), or a battlefield where contending forces vie for supremacy. It can be the “negative space” between worlds, a gulf that must be crossed in order to make safe planetfall, and within which the frail vessels of humanity are the merest motes. Or it can be a literal abyss, a void so black and empty that it threatens the lives and sanity of those human beings who dare to venture across the thresholds of night.

We call this a “toolkit” because we believe that Fate games are often _custom-built_—they are designed for a specific playgroup with particular preferences and a singular vision of the game they would like to play. So we are interested in exploring how the essential tools of Fate—the ladder, the aspect-linked fate point economy, and the Bronze Rule—can be used for space-based science fiction adventure. Our goal is to give you the tools you’ll need to get playing quickly, creating _just enough now_ and then expanding, extending, and digging deeper as the circumstances demand.

##### Other Fate Space Adventure Games

There are lots of great science fiction games based on Fate, and we’d be remiss if we didn’t point out some of the more notable ones. You can mine these games for setting details and rules approaches, kitbashing them into your own game.

*   _Baroque Space Opera_ by Mark Kowaliszyn. A galactic-scale _Fate Core_ game in the mold of _Dune_ or _Jupiter Ascending_, with high technology indistinguishable from magic available to the characters who are enmeshed in the courtly intrigues of a corrupt imperium.
*   _Bulldogs!_ by Galileo Games. You’re part of the rough-and-ready multi-species crew of a space freighter hauling cargo for long hours, all for low pay and a chance to see this corner of the galaxy, full of interesting alien cultures and worlds. Your aspects emerge from your relationship with your captain and the other crew members. The latest edition is based on _Fate Core_.
*   _Diaspora_ by VSCA Publishing. Making use of Fate’s third-edition rules and inspired by an early science fiction RPG called _Traveller_, _Diaspora_ takes a hard SF perspective and offers a lot of useful “mini-game” approaches to space combat, small-unit skirmishes, and social and political contests.
*   _Mindjammer_ by Modiphius Entertainment. This is a detailed and carefully thought-out far-future transhumanist setting for _Fate Core_ with a hard SF perspective. It holds a wealth of material to mine for ideas or adapt whole cloth.
*   _Tachyon Squadron_ by Clark Valentine (published by Evil Hat). This setting book focuses on a space-fighter squadron, with rules for dogfights and interception missions as well as the ebb and flow of events back at base during an ongoing campaign in the middle of a space war.
*   You’ll also find some space adventure themes and tools in some of Evil Hat’s Fate Worlds of Adventure, including _Andromeda_ (epic space opera in an alien galaxy), _Red Planet_ (communist pulp space fantasy), _Ghost Planets_ (_Star Trek_ meets _Forbidden Planet_ by way of _Indiana Jones_), _The Three Rocketeers_ (swashbucklers in space), and _Sails Full of Stars_ (quasi-historical fantasy in the Solar System). They are available as “pay what you want” products on drivethrurpg.com, thanks to the generosity of our Patreon backers, who support the ongoing production of new settings and adventures.

## The Plausibilometer

Our definition of “science fiction” is pretty broad, but we want to acknowledge that there is a continuum of different approaches to science-fictional world-building, and that there are some works with science-fictional trappings that some readers and critics think don’t count as science fiction at all. To sidestep all these issues of nomenclature and subgenre taxonomy, we’ll use a device that we’re calling the **plausibilometer** (PLAWS-uh-bull-OM-uh-ter) to describe how the tropes and trappings of science fiction are deployed in any given game. In your own game, you can use the plausibilometer to signal to each other some of the underlying assumptions you’re making about the way things work in your fiction.

The plausibilometer setting is an indicator of the attitude toward “realism” or “authenticity” that your group wants to enforce. It’s possible to use it in a granular way, where some setting elements are high plausibility while you let others be low or even zero plausibility. For example, many SF stories require cheap and easy faster-than-light (FTL) travel, so they allow that technology while attempting to keep everything else grounded in plausible speculation. This practice is sometimes called “blackboxing,” implying that at least some of the disruptive effects of a particular technology are not explored in the fiction. Fun games can be produced with any degree of plausibility; the plausibilometer will just help your group get on the same page.

### High Plausibility

High-plausibility games emphasize creating a coherent, internally consistent game universe in line with contemporary scientific knowledge and speculation. Part of the fun of such games is _getting the math right_, even if only figuratively—the aim is to speculate rigorously about the ramifications of scientific developments and cultural conditions.

Set the dial to high plausibility when you want a game that is grounded as much as possible in real-world science, both social and natural.

#### Reality Check

In high-plausibility games, anyone who thinks that something introduced into the fiction is sufficiently implausible may call for a **reality check**—you may even wish to put a card on the table with the words “reality check” (or “Science!”) written on it for players to point to. When someone calls for a reality check, stop play to briefly discuss what’s the matter and try to reach some accommodation or adjustment. Defer to the desire for greater realism, assuming that doing so will ultimately make everyone happier.

### Low Plausibility

In low-plausibility games, the players have a higher threshold for the willing suspension of disbelief, meaning that they’re not terribly concerned about the internal coherence of the game universe, so long as it’s dramatic or exciting. At its core, _Star Wars_—with its dogfighting space fighters, psychic space samurai, and giant space monsters—is the benchmark for low-plausibility games.

Set the dial to low plausibility when you want an over-the-top, pulp-flavored game high on atmospherics and melodrama. Low-plausibility games are not subject to reality checks—although some groups will be more resistant than others to bending, blending, or otherwise mixing up the trappings of different fictional genres in their game.

### Medium Plausibility

Between these two styles falls most science fiction. In medium-plausibility games, the emphasis frequently falls on exploring the consequences of some “What if?” conceit. They often blend and bend genre, introducing one or two big, blackboxed implausibilities in order to drive the questions in which the fiction is interested.

_Star Trek_ is a good benchmark for medium-plausibility games. There’s a lot of technobabble double-talk, but the focus of any given episode is usually on dealing with the consequences of a particular science-fictional MacGuffin, whether that’s a society of quasi-Romans, godlike aliens, or a lonesome space whale.

Set the dial to medium plausibility when you want a game that’s grounded in reality but you’re willing to take pretty big liberties with real science in the service of the game’s central premise. Players may still call for reality checks on implausible elements, but for the reality check to be upheld the new element must be shown to contradict or clash unsatisfyingly with an existing aspect or issue in the game; mere scientific implausibility is not necessarily enough to require fixing.

##### Optional Rule: The Cold Equations

“The Cold Equations” is the name of a 1954 _Astounding_ science fiction short story by Tom Godwin in which the physics of space travel necessitates that a stowaway sacrifice herself to prevent the spaceship she’s on from crashing, because the ship will run out of fuel from her unanticipated weight. The point of the story is that the laws of physics are inflexible and unforgiving, with little room for fudging.

This view is somewhat antithetical to the spirit of Fate, whose relatively low granularity means it’s always flexible. Some aspect may always be invoked to transform a potential disaster into a triumph. In some cases, this generous approach to modeling reality can conflict with the desire for scientific verisimilitude.

However, one way to deal with this conflict is to rely on the players’ own sense of scientific plausibility. In a high- or medium-plausibility game, if any player believes that something being described is a little too scientifically optimistic, they may call for “Cold Equations.” The player challenged by the Cold Equations may reply in one of two ways before they roll the dice:

*   “Science is a harsh mistress”: If the roll is a failure, invoking aspects can improve the result only up to a tie; it’s not possible to succeed or succeed with style.
*   “The human spirit always prevails”: Invoking an aspect for this roll only gives a +1 bonus, not +2, making it much more difficult—but still possible—to succeed or even succeed with style.

You may use the Cold Equations rule in addition to or in place of reality checks.

## How to Use This Book

The first chapter after this introduction is called Creating a Fate Space Game, which expands upon the basics of _Fate Core_ for creating a setting together. The next chapter is Character Creation, which discusses how to customize character generation for a Fate Space setting.

Then, we go over Spaceships and Space Travel, Space Combat, and rules for Aliens and Alien Worlds, giving you many tools for your adventures throughout space.

Finally, we lay out five sample settings for a Fate Space game, which provide concrete examples of the rules and guidelines we talk about in the earlier chapters. You can play each as-is or plunder its ideas for your own campaign:

*   The Gods Know Future Things: Posthuman space opera at subluminal speeds!
*   The High Frontiersmen: Gritty Cold War political intrigue in orbit for high stakes.
*   Mass Drivers: Realistic space drama among the interplanetary working class.
*   Millennials: Optimistic space exploration and alien encounter in a spirit of discovery.
*   Pax Galactica: Transgalactic travelogue against a somewhat baroque backdrop.

We intend for the _Fate Space Toolkit_ to offer a coherent picture of how to design a space-based science fiction adventure setting for Fate, with numerous alternatives and examples. But we also invite readers to go in either of two directions from using this book as a guide to setting design. GMs, you might want to _adopt a setting whole cloth_, developing and altering it as needed to suit your play group. Or you might want to dip into this book to _steal specific ideas_ and approaches as desired, regardless of whether or not you’ll incorporate them into a Fate Space adventure game.

# Creating a Fate Space Game

Creating a setting for a Fate Space game works as in _Fate Core_ (pages 18-27). In fact, taking time to create a Fate Space setting together is even more necessary, since it lets your group get on the same page about the fictional universe in which you’ll play, and about what issues or themes your game will focus on. Science fiction is a big, sprawling genre, and people will come to a science fiction game with lots of different assumptions about how things work.

## Brainstorming the Game

Before actually creating the setting, then, your group will want to discuss the game you’d like to play together. The following questions can help guide that conversation. Typically, the GM leads and facilitates while taking notes and recording the answers, to be used as inspiration and guidance throughout designing the setting.

*   Genre: Is there a science fiction subgenre that you want the game to emulate or invent? For example, hard-hitting near-future space techno-thriller? Far-flung, rip-roaring space opera? Gritty military SF? A space-colony coming-of-age story? Pangalactic planet-of-the-week picaresque? Sneering retropunk rodomontade, a la _Buck Rogers_ meets _A Clockwork Orange_?
*   Inspiration: Are there particular fictional touchstones from literature or film that you want the game to resemble? _Star Wars_ or _Star Trek_? _Battlestar Galactica_ or _Firefly_? _The Expanse_ or _Ancillary Justice_? _Starship Troopers_ or _The Forever War_? What elements of the game should most closely mirror that fictional setting? How might it depart from that setting?
*   Connections: Will the characters be tightly connected—for example, as members of the same spaceship crew or military outfit—or will they be chance-met and potentially independent operators, with the potential to go haring off on their own on a whim? Or will they be rivals and competitors in the same arena, with alliance and enmity as strategic possibilities? Building connections during character generation can help cement the party, giving them a reason to stick together, but allowing characters to go off on their own gives a sense of openness and freedom of action that may be particularly appropriate in some kinds of space adventure.
*   Plausibility: What level of plausibility do you want for the game? Are there particular science-fictional tropes that are especially desirable or particularly unwanted—robots, cyborgs, psionics, nanotech, or aliens, for example? As a group, set your game’s plausibilometer rating.
*   Focus: Do you want to focus on one or more outer-space-related activities—for example, space piracy, alien diplomacy, interstellar trade, space exploration, spaceship-to-spaceship combat? Or do you prefer a broader sort of campaign that touches on some or many of these topics?
*   Characters: Are there particular character archetypes or roles that you want to be possible or even encouraged? The hotshot pilot, the grizzled mercenary, the daring fleet officer, the stuffy space bureaucrat? Are there character types that you think are too banal, cliché, or trite to be fun?
*   Aliens: If the setting includes aliens, how alien should they be? Completely incomprehensible and bizarre, or psychologically strange but human enough to be playable, or is being an “alien” merely a rationale for a character to have cool albeit implausible stunts, talents, and special skills? What kind of “otherness” do aliens represent in the setting?

## Defining the Setting

The answers to the preliminary questions in the previous section essentially serve as design specifications for your setting. The next step is for _someone_ to actually pin things down and create the setting. Typically this is the GM, but it is not unheard of for one person to design a setting for someone else to run, or people could even collaborate, creating the setting together and then playing in it.

World-building can be fun and satisfying, but it can also be a lot of work. The most practical strategy is to create _just enough_ material to begin playing as quickly as possible. Minimally, a setting can be described with these elements:

*   The Pitch: A short statement summarizing the where, when, and what of the game, emphasizing what makes it awesome.
*   Scope: Specifics of tone, period, and extent, expanding the pitch and nailing down some of the setting details.
*   Issues and Aspects: Key setting elements and their expression as aspects, tying the setting into the fate point economy.
*   Faces and Places: An outline of the initial situation, giving places to go and people to meet. It also helps define the specific elements of science fiction present, such as advanced technologies, alien artifacts, and extraterrestrial beings.

### The Pitch

The pitch lays out the essence of your Fate Space game. It is an elevator pitch for the campaign—a few sentences demonstrating why this game is fun or unique. It includes a sense of what the characters do, what drives them, and what role outer space plays. The setting designer can be a GM designing the game for their home group, a third-party designer writing up a setting for others to use, or the players themselves working together in a “design committee” to create their own setting as part of the first session. Most of the time, we’ll assume a fairly traditional model—a setting designed by a GM with input from a regular group of players.

Later in this book, we’ll present the following five settings as examples of Fate Space game designs.

*   The Gods Know Future Things: Posthuman AI ship-minds in relativistic space arks shepherd the precarious Human Diaspora as it slowly expands from Sol, becoming stranger and wilder the further it goes.
*   The High Frontiersmen: An alt-1979 Cold War political spy thriller where the Earth is girdled by manned orbiting nuclear-armed battlestations, as double agents pass each other messages at a jointly occupied moonbase trying to stave off an atomic apocalypse.
*   Mass Drivers: 23rd-century space freighters living hand-to-mouth in the Asteroid Belt trying to keep body and soul and ship and crew together, avoiding the squeeze by the big corporations as much as they can.
*   Millennials: The starship _Millennium_, Earth’s first interstellar vessel, with a contingent of the planet’s best and brightest on board, makes its way to the capital of the Galactic Civilization to prove that humanity has the right stuff to join up.
*   Pax Galactica: Privileged citizens of the far-future Galactic Principate travel the spacelanes aboard luxurious interstellar liners as part of the entourage of a member of the galactic elite, to see the galaxy, or in pursuit of some vital mission.

### Scope

The scope of your game comprises its **tone**, **period** and **extent**. In combination with its plausibilometer setting, its scope lets you all know what sorts of fictional resources you are able to draw upon when creating characters and adventures. In other words, the scope establishes the range of science-fictional tropes available. Often, it provides the rationale and justification for incorporating the preferences expressed by the players while brainstorming the game, and drives the creation of setting issues and aspects.

#### Tone

The tone of your setting will either be **epic** or **personal**.

In a game with a personal tone, the characters will face problems that typically matter only to the people that they know personally: their friends and loved ones, their families, or at most their community. The obstacles are ones that affect the characters directly.

By contrast, with an epic tone, the problems that characters face and are trying to fix are consequential on a much grander scale, to people they don’t know personally and will probably never meet: their country, their homeworld, future generations, up to and including the entire universe to the end of time.

A personal game is intensely interested in the interactions among the PCs and a few NPCs. GMs, you can implement this by paying close attention to character aspects and using them to drive the action of the game; by connecting milestones to individual goals, ambitions, and achievements; and by emphasizing interpersonal interactions and decisions as the focus of play. You can reduce the value of invoking situation aspects, making character aspects more important, or you can require that at least as many character aspects as situation aspects must be invoked for any given action. You can limit your use of the Bronze Rule, so that characters are always interacting with individuals rather than with groups, organizations, or other large-scale entities.

An epic game, in contrast, cares more about the big-picture consequences and ramifications of the characters’ actions and choices. GMs, you can implement this by driving the action more with situation and setting aspects; by using milestones to build and shape the setting (_Fate Core_, pages 263-265); and by allowing individual PCs to interact meaningfully with larger groups, organizations, and entities via the Bronze Rule (_Fate Core_, page 270). You could also reduce the value of invoking character aspects, which would get players thinking about how to invoke situation aspects. You could use scale rules in the _Fate System Toolkit_ (page 67) to give large-scale actions an advantage, again getting players to work toward gaining control of things that would let them take large-scale actions.

Each choice about tone has its own advantages and disadvantages. A personal game lets the players shape the direction of the game and puts the narrative spotlight on their characters, but without strong character motivations and connections it can seem somewhat unfocused. An epic game makes the PCs important to their universe and lends consequence to their choices, but may wind up subordinating the PCs’ stories to a larger plot arc in a way that makes the characters less interesting and the game more linear.

Many games will wind up being mixed in tone, but it is good to establish up front toward which end of the tone spectrum—intimately personal at one end, and grandiosely epic at the other—the game should lean.

##### Tone? Scale?

Note that what we are calling “tone” is called “scale” in _Fate Core_ (page 21), but we want to reserve “scale” for indicating mechanical differences in size and duration.

#### Period (Genre)

The period of your game indicates its relationship in time to the world of the present. Usually, it will be at some more or less distant point in the future, but it may also be more complicated.

Near Future: As soon as tomorrow, as late as a few hundred years from now. The advantage of this period is that you can use details and trends from Earth’s history and current events as background material. The disadvantage is that greater plausibility requires stricter attention to real-world considerations. Perhaps **A Dystopian World Order** exists on Earth in which **Flooded Coastal Regions Worldwide** have given rise to an **Enormous Spaceward Migration** underwritten by **Wealthy Megacorporate Oligarchs** who reap the benefits. This setting seems somewhat more plausible than a future where **A New Space Race** has arisen due to the **Superpower Rivalry Between India and China**, which in turn seems much more plausible than one where the **United Nations Terraforming Authority Is In Charge**, marshaling personnel and equipment and directing missions to extract resources from space to preserve and extend human-supporting ecosystems on Earth and other planets. In general, the more dramatically convenient the political, social, technological, or other changes needed to get to the particular future you want, the lower you’ll need to turn the plausibilometer dial.

Far Future: More than a few hundred years from now. Numerous discontinuities between the present and the far future mean that there’s no easy way to make projections, but this can also be liberating, lowering obstacles to the suspension of disbelief. Far-future stories might be set where **Earth Is a Post-Apocalyptic Wasteland** whose survivors have **One Last Shot at the Stars**, or where humanity is thriving and **Scattered Across the Galaxy**, so that **Earth Is a Dim Memory or Vague Legend**.

Alternate History: Alt-history settings explore “counterfactuals” like **What If They Hadn’t Canceled the Apollo Program?** or **What If the Russians Beat the U.S. to the Moon?** They tend to be set in an altered version of the past or predicted future that feels a little disorienting while still echoing contemporary concerns. A description of the resulting culture may be as simple as **The Nineties, but with Commercial Space Flights to Orbital Habitats** or may require several aspects to explain, such as **A Nuclear Sword of Damocles over the U.S.**, **The Kremlin Is the 800-Pound Bear**, and **Insular and Isolated**.

Retrofuture: The future as imagined by the past. These are usually but not necessarily low-plausibility settings, including Buck Rogers-style **Raygun Gothic**, heavy on the pulp, with aeroplane-styled rocketships. Other examples include swept-fin chrome-plated 1950s-style _Rocketship Galileo_ sci-fi with **Bug-Eyed Monsters** (BEMs), **Little Green Men** (LGMs), and **Space Nazis**, as well as Hugo Gernsback-flavored “scientifiction” with Hail Victoria moonshot cannonades and with most solar planets not only capable of harboring life, but boasting extensive civilizations often inimical to planet Earth! Players pick this genre because they like its “color” or fictional trappings. Steampunk, which blends a Victorian-era setting with clanking steam-powered alternative technologies, belongs in this category.

#### Extent

The extent of your game is the physical space across which space travel takes place in it. This affects the diversity of alien life and cultures that the setting may plausibly encompass, among other things. It’s always useful to draw a map of the extent, but even writing down an aspect to define the extent can help. Here are some examples.

Interplanetary: The sun and its satellites, both natural and artificial. This extent allows for games with very high plausibility, since no recourse to FTL is needed to get our heroes to the scene of the action. Some games will range over **The Entire Solar System**, while others will focus on **The Inner System**: everything inside the orbit of Jupiter. Other games will be almost purely orbital, focusing on getting to space and maybe the Moon, with Mars a distant dream.

Local Space: The stellar neighborhood immediately surrounding the Solar System, out to maybe thirty, fifty, or even a hundred light-years. There are **Hundreds of Star Systems** in that radius, but perhaps only **A Handful of Inhabited Worlds**. The Solar System in general and Earth in particular is probably the most important center of civilization. At this extent, Earth-like worlds and even traces of sentient aliens have very low plausibility, although the **Search for Alien Life** or **Hunt for Habitable Planets** may be a big deal.

Near Space: The stellar neighborhood **Inside a Few Hundred Light-Years of the Solar System**. It may contain **Dozens of Habitable Worlds**. Settlement may come from a central point—**Earth and Its Colonies**—or there may be multiple centers of civilization in some degree of contention with each other—**Warring Successor States**, perhaps. The presence of at least **A Few Earth-like Worlds** is more plausible, and **Contact with a Sentient Alien Species** or two wouldn’t raise any eyebrows.

Galactic: **The Entire Milky Way** or its equivalent a long time ago and far away. **Multiple Waves of Expansion, Settlement, and Contraction** may have created **A Broad and Diverse Tapestry of Civilizations**, both human and alien (or posthuman) on a myriad of worlds, worldlets, and artificial habitats. Alternately, humanity may have fallen into a **Galactic Dark Age** with only **A Few Beacons of Civilization Still Burning**, or the entire galaxy may be groaning **Under the Heel of an All-Powerful Galactic Tyrant**.

### Issues and Aspects

In creating a Fate Space game, the main addition to _Fate Core_ is considering how space travel works and what other technologies exist. However, both of these considerations emerge from thinking about the game’s big issues, which are usually at least implied by the pitch.

#### Big Issues

Defining a game’s issues and aspects is fundamental. According to _Fate Core_ (page 22), the things that spur characters to action are a game’s “big issues.” Big issues will imply what _Fate Core_ calls “story questions”: implicit challenges and plot hooks that drive the action. Here are some examples of issues and their associated story questions.

*   **Alien Invasion!**: Can we stop them? At what cost? What will we do if it seems like the aliens are winning? What will we sacrifice for victory?
*   **Uranium Rush in the Asteroid Belt**: What does it take to strike it rich? What happens when we succeed? What happens if we fail or give up?
*   **Grand Tour of the Galaxy**: How will we respond to the alien beings we meet and the alien places we visit? What local entanglements and resentments will we encounter? What problems are we carrying with us that will bear bitter fruit as we travel?

The big issues that define the setting may be treated as aspects. This means both that _they are generally true in the setting_ and that _they may be invoked_ for a narrative or mechanical effect under appropriate circumstances. They may also be modified or revisited at milestones. It is possible to drill down into a big issue to assign it specific aspects, which may themselves be treated according to the Bronze Rule (_Fate Core_, page 270) and fleshed out with other statistics. The Fate term for such quasi-characters—whether extraterrestrial hiveminds, alien societies, robot armies, natural disasters, or planetwide transportation networks—is **setting el****ement**.

*   **Orbiting Zithari Invasion Fleet**, an aspect of the alien invasion. GM might invoke to create obstacles related to orbital bombardment or enemy surveillance; PCs might compel to establish advantageous details about the composition of the fleet (ill-prepared for sustained planetary blockade!) or its routine (small blind spot in its orbital pattern provides an opportunity for stealth!). It is probably accompanied by **Zithari Ground Occupation Forces**.
*   **Space-Mining Megacorporations**, an aspect of the uranium rush. GM might invoke to create obstacles related to the megacorps’ deep pockets and profit-driven decision-making; PCs might compel to establish interorganizational rivalries and competition as well as bureaucratic inefficiencies.
*   **Pretentious Galactic Elite**, an aspect of the galactic grand tour. GM might invoke to create obstacles related to enforcing status hierarchies, pecking orders, and cliquish insularity; PCs might compel to establish cultural norms or ways of life that give them an advantage, such as being “in” with the haut monde.

In other words, you can treat a big issue as if it at least _potentially_ possessed some combination of aspects, skills, stunts, stress, and consequences, all while treating it as an aspect in and of itself. Usually, adding stress and consequences is more appropriate for games with epic tone, since it allows PCs to more easily push for significant, broad change in the setting, like “I take out the whole **Alien Invasion!**” Normally, affecting a big issue requires reaching a significant or major milestone (_Fate Core_, pages 264-265) by dealing with specific foes, antagonists, or problems.

#### Setting Aspects as “Black Boxes”

We’ll use the term **black** **box** to refer to any potentially important science fiction setting element. These are technologies or scientific contrivances, and in some fiction their likely consequences are not fully thought out before their introduction. For example, script writers don’t often consider things like how the nonscarcity economy implied by the existence of food replicators in the _Star Trek_ universe affects the Federation (but see Manu Saadia’s _Trekonomics_ for an extended discussion of the replicator). Though a technology that can manipulate matter at a molecular level is both _really powerful_ and _really interesting_, it’s not the point of the show, so it gets moved into the background.

So in effect, a black box is Just the Way Things Are, without further consequence or implication to the setting. It signals that certain problems—like “How do we get our food while we’re in space?”—are not interesting in the fiction. At least, not most of the time. But in a Fate Space game, it is often worthwhile to keep track of black boxes for the times when they can lead to challenges or opportunities that might prove very interesting, indeed!

For example, any of these fictional details can be treated as a black box:

*   Antigravity in the deck plates
*   Hyperspace technology
*   Personal teleportation belts
*   Extended human lifespan

A black box is probably _not_ going to be an aspect in the game, at least not when it’s first identified. Not all fictional details in the setting have to be aspects, which are simply details that are sufficiently consequential that we give them mechanical hooks.

However, once established, a black box _can_ become a plot point in an adventure, even if most of the time it is ignored. Suddenly the grav plates are on the fritz; the power crystals are slowly depleting while the ship is trapped in hyperspace mid-jump; the calibration sensors on this TP-belt are out of alignment; or the captain’s nanogerionic therapy regimen has caused a harmful mutation. Any of these can be an issue that requires time and attention during play. Thus, black boxes can imply, inspire, and collect aspects that make the setting feel more plausible and coherent. For example, the black box “personal teleportation belts” might inspire the following aspects:

*   **We Don’t Need Roads**: Transportation infrastructure tends to be very limited, since you can teleport anywhere you want to go.
*   **Security Mazes**: Security and privacy rely on disorienting intruders and keeping them off-balance, since preventing physical intrusion is very difficult.

A fun and productive way to collaborate in fleshing out the setting is to have players suggest interesting details associated with the setting elements that have been established. Then, in play, GM, pay attention to the possibilities implicit in the ongoing stream of talk that is your game, whether or not those possibilities have been formally established as aspects or identified as black boxes.

> During setting creation, a player suggests that their ship’s life-support system is really a sophisticated nanotechnological microecology, complete with food chains and carbon dioxide-oxygen cycling. It’s a background detail, offered for its coolness and strangeness, and it’s readily accepted by the group, since it means they can safely ignore the ins and outs of the life-support system.

> Later, during play, the GM wants to complicate the characters’ lives when they arrive in orbit around an alien world. She “opens up” the black box of the ship’s life-support system and creates an aspect for the ship, creating its **Sophisticated Nanotechnological Microecology** as a new aspect of the ship. Having done this, the GM decides that it would be fun if a glitch—precise cause to be determined later—has made the ship’s photosynthetic nanolichen go haywire, and creates a situation aspect **Too Much Oxygen!** that can be invoked to cause oxygen narcosis on the bridge or an explosion on the observation deck. She expects that characters will use their skills to diagnose and repair the problem while dealing with the aliens, whom one **Xenophobic** character suspects of sabotage.

Some GMs and groups will want to make this process more systematic. If you wish, you can keep a list of black boxes with specific details and relevant aspects, recording new entries as they are identified in play. Other groups will find it more enjoyable to keep the elaboration of black boxes as a completely ad hoc process.

Take care to avoid having too many aspects in play at once. Enforce a limit of two to four setting aspects, including both big issues and “opened up” black boxes. In any event, one of the most important black boxes in a Fate Space game is space travel. Implementing this technology is discussed in greater detail in Spacecraft and Space Travel.

### Faces and Places

Defining important setting elements is a key to getting the game started. People and locations—faces and places—provide hooks for players to hang their characters’ stories on. In creating a setting, the setting designer introduces some faces and places so that players will have rivals, foils, targets, and others with whom to interact, both as part of the backstories they create for their characters and as part of the ongoing fiction. When designing faces and places, keep in mind that they will be subject to a great deal of character attention and interest, and may change as a result of character action.

#### The Space Map

It is also a good idea at this point to sketch out a **space** **map** to help give players a sense of the extent of the setting. Each sample setting in this book has a space map, and the creation of space maps is discussed in greater detail in <span>The Space Map.</span>

#### Aliens and Alien Societies (Different Cultures)

The presence or absence of aliens and their role in the setting, including specific alien species and civilizations, can be included with the faces and places to help players create characters. This is also where the setting rules about aliens can be introduced. In some settings, aliens will be very common and a new alien species—even a spacefaring one—can be introduced by anyone as a setting detail; in others, the presence of aliens on a given world will affect play significantly and will require the GM to bring them in. This is discussed in greater detail in <span>Creating Aliens.</span>

More broadly, you can identify any sorts of cultural distinction in the setting. For example, in the sample setting _The High Frontiersmen_, some PCs may be Russian cosmonauts while others will be American astronauts.

#### Extraterrestrial Planets

Specific extraterrestrial planets can be identified in the faces and places, again to aid character creation. Similarly, rules and procedures for coming up with new worlds can be tailored to the setting depending on its extent. This is discussed in greater detail in Aliens and Alien Worlds.

##### Aliens and Other Strangers

For many people, science fiction is an opportunity to explore new and unexpected possibilities in a socially safe space. Even gonzo ideas can often be accommodated easily without changing the mechanics: an alien character might have exactly the same rules as everyone else, but the fiction allows the player to have cat ears and a long tail. Fate is robust enough that a science fiction-inflected aspect like **Bionic Arm**, **Neural Interface**, or **Uplifted Dolphin** acts just like any other aspect.

However, aspects can also be invoked to declare a story detail, so while creating the setting and characters, your group will want to discuss the possible range of narrative effects of science fiction aspects, so everyone is on the same page.

# Character Creation

One of the most powerful ways to establish the setting of a Fate Space game is in character creation. That way the players have a reminder of what the game is about in front of them at all times, right on their character sheet.

In this chapter, we’ll go through some ways to differentiate the characters’ core aspects, give some new options for skills and stunts suitable for a Fate Space game, and explore new extras that will let you add specific sci-fi flavors to your game.

## Aspects

Typically, characters are defined by their **high concept** and **trouble**, as in _Fate Core_. Additional aspects emerge from the **phase trio** (_Fate Core_, pages 38-44) to help define a character’s backstory and their history with the other characters. To help reinforce the setting, you might modify the procedures described in _Fate Core_, such as by changing the phase trio or by changing the kinds of aspects that characters have can.

### High Concept

In general, GMs, you’ll want to give guidance to players that will let them focus their high concept to serve the pitch and scope of your game—for example, “You are all crew or otherwise permanent party aboard an interstellar tramp freighter that makes frequent port calls on frontier planets. Your high concept should be consistent with this situation.”

Part of a character’s high concept may refer to their background—their planet of origin or homeworld, their species or ethnicity, and so forth. In such cases, it may be worth it to discuss the possible invocations and compels of that aspect prior to the beginning of the play in greater detail than usual.

Here are some examples:

*   **Spacer**: Invoke to reflect familiarity with space-going culture and folkways, including moving around in microgravity easily. Compel to suffer weakness and the possibility of injury in normal and high gravity, and to suffer the prejudices of planetbound people.
*   **Cyborg**. Invoke to reflect machine-augmented physical and computer-related capabilities. Compel to have to deal with software glitches, mechanical failures, or electronic short-circuits as well as the effects of an increasing psychological detachment from humanity.
*   **Slowtimer**: Invoke to access millennia-old secrets, information, and data from your long years of experience; compel to be blindsided by recent developments, changes, and anomalies.

### Trouble

A character’s trouble is a good way to reinforce the tone and themes of the setting and connect characters to the fictional universe, so when you’re designing a setting you should keep in mind what sorts of trouble you’d like to see characters get into. Thus, you can sometimes specify that the characters’ troubles come from a complication related to the setting itself, such as the characters’ relationships to a military or naval hierarchy in which you expect them to be located, or the intergalactic code of ethics that they all vowed to uphold.

### Phase Trio

In addition to using the phase trio to connect the PCs, you may wish to use it to connect them and their actions to the setting’s history and to important institutions, organizations, and NPCs. For example, in a game about fleeing alien space invaders across interstellar space, a character’s first phase could be _Life Before They Came_, followed by _During the Invasion_, and finally _At the Exodus_. If you do this, though, be sure that each phase still connects one PC to another.

## Skills

You’ll want to customize the skill list from _Fate Core_ to highlight how characters in your setting handle the challenges they face. You can do this by changing some of the skills from _Fate Core_, creating new skills that show how characters in your setting can take action, or both. The skill list defines what characters will do, and new skills can help define the flavor of the setting. For example, if there is a skill called “Astronaut,” this implies a certain right-stuff way of piloting a spacecraft, while “Star Pilot” implies something different again.

##### A Skill By Any Other Name

Throughout the rest of the book, all references to specific skills also refer to the equivalent, setting-specific skill variants and names. For example, a stunt that refers to Shoot also refers to Firearms, as long as the stunt would reasonably apply to using Firearms.

### Modify the Default Skills

Adapt the skill list from _Fate Core_ to reflect your specific SF setting. We give some options in this section, but it’s not an exhaustive list. We also give a few example stunts.

#### Crafts

Option One: Rename Crafts to Engineering or Technology. This skill is used to operate, repair, design, and otherwise deal with technology of all kinds. Its stunts typically represent expertise in specific technical areas, or heavy machinery, robots, and high-tech toolkits.

*   Bioengineering: Because you are a trained bioengineer, you may use Engineering or Technology in place of Lore to create advantages representing biomechanical modifications or cybernetic augmentations, or to overcome obstacles related to medical conditions or treatment.
*   Life-Support Engineering: Because you are a trained life-support engineer, you gain +2 when using Engineering or Technology to overcome obstacles related to maintaining, repairing, or replacing life-support technology.
*   Xenotech: Because you are familiar with the principles of alien technology, you gain +2 when using Engineering or Technology to overcome obstacles related to understanding or adapting alien technology.

Option Two: Rename Crafts to Technoscience. This skill includes authoritative knowledge of natural phenomena as predicted, controlled, and explained via technical means, and so it subsumes the relevant part of Lore, which may be renamed “Culture” or something similar to reflect its more limited character.

*   Theoretician: Because of your training and intellect, you gain +2 when using Technoscience to create advantages that refer to interesting or useful empirical implications of abstract scientific models. For example, a character might use a Technoscience success to note that if the artificial gravity fields in the ship’s deck plates can be manipulated with sufficient precision, and thus **Focused Gravitational Lensing** would permit **Localized Invisibility Fields**. The latter advantage could then justify the use of Technoscience to create invisibility fields aboard the ship controlled from the life-support workstation; **Focused Gravitational Lensing** might also lead to other specific innovations, like tractor beams and pressor arrays.

Option Three: Divide Crafts into Operate, Repair, and Design. Operate is limited to using technological devices not covered by another skill. Repair includes troubleshooting and fixing problems as they emerge. Design allows for modifying devices and creating new ones. Each skill is independent and discrete, so Repair doesn’t let you also Operate. Alternately, you can allow a more knowledge-intensive skill to be used in place of a less-intensive one, albeit against higher opposition, or vice versa, substituting the less-intensive skill for the more-intensive one. In general, Operate is the least knowledge-intensive while Design is the most knowledge-intensive.

*   Miracle Worker: Because you work well under pressure, you gain +2 when using Repair to treat consequences taken by a spaceship or other vehicle.

If the generally available technology level varies from place to place in your setting, you might want to supplement option three by adding **tech levels**. For example, a galactic setting where each world has a distinct culture might classify planets according their relative levels of technological achievement.

#### Drive

Option 1: Split Drive into Ride, Drive, and Pilot. Ride is the skill for using mounts, while Drive is for operating vehicles with relatively simple controls, and Pilot is for operating complex vehicles, like spacecraft and starships. Alternately, you can forgo Ride and instead include horse riding and the like in Athletics or Planetary Survival.

Option 2: Replace Drive with Operate. Operate covers the use of all technological devices. Stunts can be used to reflect expertise with specific vehicles.

*   Hot Pilot: Because you are a skilled spacepilot, you gain +2 to overcome with Operate when piloting a space fighter or other small spacecraft.
*   Space Ace: Because you are steely-nerved combat pilot, you may attack with Operate when you are piloting a space fighter or other small, armed spacecraft.
*   Seat-of-the-Pants Navigator: Because you have an uncanny knack for space navigation, you may use Pilot in place of the equivalent navigation skill (e.g., Astrogation, Science) to set a course from point A to point B in normal space.

#### Lore

Option 1: Rename Knowledge. Knowledge sounds more appropriate for a science fiction game than Lore, which has a fantasy feel. You can double down on this to better describe your setting, calling it Education, Data Access, Information, or Memory instead—each name has different implications, especially for interacting with information technology and computer data.

*   Data Analyst: Because you are skilled at data analysis, you gain +2 to create advantages with Knowledge when you can consult accumulated data records about the object of your analysis.
*   Boolean Ace: Because you are expert at searching through large databases, you may use Knowledge in place of Investigate when you have access to data records about the target of your investigation.

Option 2: Split Lore into Culture and Science. The former skill represents social and cultural knowledge, including the arts and humanities as well as common-sense knowledge of a given culture. The latter skills represent systematic knowledge of the social and natural worlds, respectively.

*   Synesthete: Because you are a synesthetic poet, you may use Culture in place of Provoke when you perform one of your multi-sensory compositions for a receptive or captive audience.
*   Experimentalist: Because you are trained in scientific experimentation, you gain +2 to create advantages with Science by testing an empirical hypothesis about some physical phenomenon.

Option 3: Split Lore into multiple discipline-based sub-skills. Broad fields of inquiry are presumed to represent bodies of knowledge and ways of knowing related to science, the arts and humanities, and other fields. Stunts can represent specialized training or education and professional recognition and achievement, like a physician’s license.

*   Arts: Subsumes that part of Lore related to cultural expression. Its stunts are often related to specific art forms like Painting, Sculpture, and Literature, giving +2 to creating advantages with that art form.
*   Humanities: Subsumes that part of Lore related to knowledge of specific human events, ideas, and creations. Its stunts are often related to specific disciplines like History, Philosophy, and Law, giving +2 to creating advantages with that discipline.
*   Social Science: Subsumes that part of Lore related to systematic knowledge of human behavior, interactions, and motivations. Its stunts are often related to specific social sciences like Anthropology, Sociology, and Psychology, giving +2 to creating advantages with that science.
*   Natural Science: Subsumes that part of Lore related to systematic knowledge of material phenomena. Its stunts are often related to specific natural sciences like Physics, Chemistry, and Planetology, giving +2 to creating advantages with that science. A scientist’s skill to make new scientific discoveries or theoretical breakthroughs may require a stunt (Experimentalist or Theoretician, for example) unless the setting embraces the notion of rapid scientific advancement.

#### Shoot

Option 1\. Rename Shoot to Weapons or Warfare. This reflects some degree of familiarity with all of the weapons and weapons systems, large and small, used to launch beams, projectiles, and other deadly payloads at targets. Stunts can reflect expertise with particular types of combat, like Space Combat, Small-Unit Tactics, or Armored Warfare.

Option 2\. Divide Shoot into categories of weapons. Different types of weapons may require different skill sets to operate, such as Firearms (for handguns and other small arms) and Gunnery (for space naval heavy weaponry). Use stunts to represent expertise with particular classes of weapon.

*   Deadeye Aim: Because you are uncannily accurate with space weapons, once per scene you can gain +4, rather than +2, to your Gunnery attack when you invoke an advantage you’ve created related to taking aim or getting a target in your sights.
*   Final Protective Fire: Because you are a trained point-defense gunner, you may spend a fate point to attack multiple defenders during a single exchange with Gunnery. Before you roll, declare all of your defenders and the order in which you will attack them. For each defender after the first you declare, you suffer -1 to each of your attacks. Roll and resolve each attack in order; a given invocation applies only to one attack, not all of them.
*   Sniper: Gain +2 to attack with Firearms when you’re firing a personal firearm at a defender that is two or more zones away.

Option 3\. Keep Shoot for Small Arms Only. Alternately, presume that Shoot refers to hand weapons only, and assign space weapons to other skills such as Drive (Pilot) or Crafts (Engineering).

### Create New Skills

Use new skills to highlight important activities in your setting. Some skills may only be available as extras, depending on the setting.

#### Astrogation

Knowledge of the technical procedures and professional practices needed to calculate a vessel’s space journey. Use this skill to plot courses through interplanetary and interstellar space as well as to jump through hyperspace or another FTL jaunt—assuming that FTL travel doesn’t require some other skill such as Psionics for navigation. If there is no special skill for navigation in space, the requisite knowledge can be included in a Lore-equivalent skill such as Science or Natural Science. Astrogation is often used in an overcome action to set a course in space, but it may also be treated as including those parts of Lore or its equivalent related to general knowledge of port conditions, nearby space hazards, and similar information about known ports of call. It is generally used neither to attack nor to defend.

The difficulty of course calculation depends on the complexity of the course and the capabilities of the ship. Planning a straightforward trip from Planet A to Planet B across distances within the ship’s normal range and endurance may face Mediocre (+0) or Average (+1) difficulty, while trying to calculate the complicated series of burns needed to decelerate a slower-than-light generation ship coming in from interstellar space with limited delta-vee (change in velocity) by means of multiple planetary fly-bys that may subject the ship to structural stress may face Great (+4), Superb (+5), or even Fantastic (+6) difficulty.

The GM will set the time required for the journey based on the distances involved and the speeds obtainable, remembering that periods of acceleration, deceleration, and possibly coasting will occur. Express the time required in “half,” “one,” “a few,” or “several” units of time, per _Fate Core_ (page 197). Attainable speeds will depend in large measure upon the technology available in your setting, discussed in greater detail in Spacecraft and Space Travel.

Succeeding with style on Astrogation may create boosts such as **Fuel-Efficient Course** or **Planetary Syzygy** that can be used as a bonus if Pilot is needed to complete the maneuver. Alternatively, succeeding with style can simply reduce the time required for travel by one shift, meaning a trip that would take a few months will only take one.

Failure can result in “no solution”—the ship lacks the requisite delta-vee to get to its destination. Conditions must change before any recalculation is possible. Alternately, failure can mean that the course plot is inaccurate, requiring additional expenditures of reaction mass or other resources to correct, or that the ship is subjected to structural stress or other damage, or that the time required to travel increases by one shift, or perhaps two shifts of time if you get three or more shifts of failure.

*   Starblazer: Because of your attention to detail, you gain +2 to Astrogation when you are plotting a course to a place where no one has gone before—or at least, no one of whom you’re aware.
*   Stargazer: Because you’ve pored over the available star charts and sky maps, you gain +2 to Astrogation when creating advantages related to knowing astrographic information about the region of space into which you are traveling.

#### Bureaucracy

This is knowledge of the workings of large, impersonal, hierarchical institutions such as government agencies, corporations, and the military. It is used to overcome obstacles and create advantages related to knowing the rules, policies, and protocols of the organization, dealing with red tape, and winning at office politics. A more neutral label for this skill is “Administration,” which also implies a certain level of managerial competence. This skill is useful when trying to convince starport officials that an out-of-date docking license still passes muster, that a cargo of exotic animals doesn’t fall under extant quarantine regulations, and so forth.

*   Barrack-Room Lawyer: Because of your vast knowledge of administrative trivia, you may use Bureaucracy in place of Rapport to attack or create advantages when the act of throwing out legalistic or official-sounding terms and concepts might be convincing.
*   Red Tape-Cutter: Because you have a good idea about which shortcuts an organization is likely to tolerate, you gain +2 to overcome obstacles with Bureaucracy when attempting to demonstrate that you have met an organization’s requirements or followed its stipulated procedures.

#### Command

This is the skill for directing, inspiring, and leading people. You can use it to overcome obstacles and create advantages related to coordinating the activities of groups and individuals, keeping up morale, and ensuring good order among the troops. It subsumes the relevant parts of Rapport and Provoke.

*   Charisma: Because you are an inspirational leader, you gain +2 to create advantages with Command when you try to maintain or improve the morale of your followers.
*   Martinet: Because you have a reputation as a strict disciplinarian, you gain +2 to overcome with Command when you are trying to enforce compliance with behavioral rules and regulations among the people you’re leading.

#### Encounter

If aliens are relatively infrequent or very strange in your setting, you’ll use Encounter—rather than Deceive, Provoke, or Rapport—to interact with them. It is used to overcome or create advantages. If a listed skill doesn’t exist, the appropriate interaction is used instead. In any case, certain aliens may get a bonus to Will or Empathy to reflect the difficulty other species have in engaging them, though this bonus will probably be more common if you do not include Encounter.

*   Alien Whisperer: Because you have an intuitive or learned understanding of alien psychology, you may use Encounter in place of Empathy when trying to make sense of alien motivations or desires.
*   Practically Raised by Martians: Because of your familiarity with their culture and traditions, you gain +2 to Encounter when dealing with Martians. (You can rename this stunt to apply it to another specific alien civilization.)

#### Planetary Survival

Planetary Survival replaces that part of Lore related to practical knowledge of “roughing it” in uncivilized conditions. It may also include that part of Lore used to administer first aid; in this case, more advanced medical training is a stunt that permits the use of Science in place of Planetary Survival for that purpose. Its stunts may also be used to enhance survival skill on a specific planet or a particular type of planet—which means that how planets are classified, or what types of planets exist in your setting, is important in creating such stunts.

*   Absolute Zero: Because of your experience on such worlds, you gain +2 to Planetary Survival when overcoming hazardous groundside conditions on frozen worlds, like those in the outer reaches of a solar system.
*   Habitable World Training: Pick a certain class of habitable world present in the setting, such as one on the Habitable Worlds table. Because of your experience on such worlds, you gain +2 to overcome obstacles related to hazardous groundside conditions on such a world.
*   Dirtside Medic: Because of your practical experience, you gain +2 to Planetary Survival when treating mild and moderate physical consequences suffered by others as a result of exposure to planetary conditions.

#### Psionics

Psionics allows you to use the power of your mind to affect the real world. It is typically only used to create advantages related to using your psychic powers to affect the world around you. Here are some examples of using Psionics:

> “I use my psionics to cloud the guard’s mind.” This will create **Clouded Mind** by succeeding with Psionics against the guard’s Will.

> “I probe the alien’s brain and evoke its deepest fear.” This will create **Tentacular Terror!** by succeeding with Psionics against the alien’s Will.

> “I telekinetically pull at the wires inside the guard’s EVA suit.” This will create **Compromised Suit** by succeeding with Psionics against the guard’s Notice.

Stunts can expand the range and versatility of the Psionics skill.

*   Psionic Navigation: Because of your psychic training, you may use Psionics in place of Astrogation to calculate interstellar paths through hyperspace.
*   Psychic Blast: Because of your psychic training, you may attack with Psionics against the defender’s Will or Psionics.
*   Telekinetic Force: Because of your psychic training, you may use Psionics in place of Physique to lift, throw, hurl, or crush nearby objects as if you had enormous strength.

#### Rank

Rank reflects a character’s status and position within a hierarchical organization and thus indicates their efficacy in utilizing their official powers, working as a sort of combination of Resources and Contacts when dealing with that organization. A character’s Rank rating might not correspond to their in-fiction rank. For example, a star admiral with Mediocre (+0) Rank still outranks a space sergeant with Fair (+2) Rank in the fiction, but the space sergeant would be better at getting the detachment ready for inspection or obtaining a much-needed hyperthermal coupler at stardock during refitting.

*   Rank Hath Its Privileges: You may use Rank in place of Resources to create advantages related to obtaining personal wealth or goods for your private use from your organization.
*   Highly Decorated: You may use Rank in place of Rapport to create advantages related to using your words to inspire, motivate, or otherwise lift up members of your organization.

#### Spacehand

Spacehand subsumes those parts of Lore and Crafts associated with practical knowledge of shipboard life. It is typically used to overcome and defend against difficulties connected to living, working, and moving in space. This includes moving around in zero-g, wearing a spacesuit properly so as to avoid accident or injury while in vacuum, walking on the outside of a spacecraft hull, and so on. You’ll use this skill whenever something out of the ordinary happens in a space environment. Need to don your spacesuit in record time? Roll Spacehand. Need to patch a micro-meteor leak? Roll Spacehand. In a near-future setting, this skill can be called Astronaut—or Cosmonaut.

*   Old Space Dog: Because you’ve been around a time or two, you may use Spacehand in place of Contacts when looking for a spacer in a starport or other likely meeting place for professional space travelers.
*   Spacewalker: Because you are well trained in extra-vehicular activity, you gain +2 to Spacehand when overcoming obstacles related to operations outside a spacecraft.
*   Zero-Gee Acrobatics: Because you are skilled at low-gravity movement, you may use Spacehand in place of Athletics to move in microgravity, as long as there are surfaces that you can push against.
*   Zero-Gee Martial Arts: Because you are familiar with fighting in zero-gee, you may use Spacehand in place of Fight to attack in hand-to-hand combat while in microgravity.

## Stunts

You can use stunts to add a science-fictional gloss to otherwise normal skills.

### Athletics

Athletics stunts can reflect the physiological advantages accrued from alien, mutant, cyborg, and similar anatomical variations. Power armor, performance-enhancing drugs, and prosthetic limbs and organs may also justify Athletics stunts.

*   Glandular Implant: Because you have been implanted with an artificial adrenaline gland, once per session when you are using Athletics to overcome or defend, you may spend a fate point to treat your dice roll as <span>++++ before or after rolling them.</span>
*   Tentacles: Because you have powerful manipulator tentacles, you gain +2 to Athletics when creating advantages related to grabbing, grasping, or holding on to something.

### Burglary

Burglary stunts can represent high-tech lockpicks and safecracking gear. If your setting includes regions of different technological sophistication, you can use Burglary stunts to reflect the advantages of greater technical knowledge and preparation.

*   Ninja Skills: Because you have received special training, you gain +2 to Burglary when overcoming low-tech security equipment and procedures, such as unaugmented guards, mechanical locks, and pressure plates.

### Contacts

Contacts stunts can reflect a reputation among particular groups or a wide array of acquaintances on certain planets. They also could reflect being wired into information technology and communications networks.

*   Traveller: Because you have traveled extensively throughout the galaxy, whenever you return to a planet that you’ve ever visited, you gain +2 to Contacts to overcome difficulties in finding someone you need to find or want to meet. Additionally, you may spend a fate point when you first arrive on a new world to declare that you have been to this place before.

### Crafts

See _Fate Core_, page 102.

### Deceive

Deceive stunts can reflect the advantages possessed by particularly inscrutable or hard-to-read alien species. Also, sophisticated disguise kits and similar technologies justify a Deceive stunt.

*   Mask-Like Countenance: Because your facial expressions are particularly neutral or otherwise hard to read, you gain +2 to defend with Deceive versus efforts to discern your true motivations, intentions, or nature using Empathy or Investigate.
*   Personality Graft: Because you can imprint personality patterns upon your brain, you may spend a fate point to imprint the patterns of an individual that you’ve observed, gaining +2 to create advantages and overcome obstacles with Deceive when you are imitating or impersonating that individual.

### Drive

See _Fate Core_, page 106.

### Empathy

Empathy stunts can reflect alien, mutant, or cyborg abilities, as well as advanced neuroscientific equipment.

*   Projective Telempath: Because you have psionic powers, you may attack with Empathy versus Will, sending out waves of emotion after emotion that produce mind-shattering catharsis in the target.
*   Telempathic Healing: Because you have psionic powers, once per session you may reduce the severity of someone’s else’s consequence by one step by succeeding with Empathy against Mediocre (+0) difficulty for a mild consequence, Fair (+2) for moderate, and Great (+4) for severe. If you succeed, you then take a mild consequence. If you fail, you may succeed at a cost by taking a consequence of the severity you healed.
*   Vee-Kay Analyzer: Because you have access to special equipment, you gain +2 to Empathy when trying to figure out someone’s psychological stressors or breaking points during an interview.

### Fight

Fight stunts can reflect training with particular weapons, especially stylishly futuristic ones. They may also refer to fighting styles or schools, or to maneuvers and strikes with futuristic weapons.

*   Energy-Staff Feint: Because of your _peregrinato_-warrior training, you gain +2 to create advantages with Fight when using your energy staff to blind, disorient, or otherwise discomfit your opponent.
*   Zero-Gee Brawling: Because you have trained as a space marine, you gain +2 to attack with Fight when you are in hand-to-hand combat in microgravity conditions.

### Investigate

Investigate stunts may reflect sophisticated cognitive capabilities as well as high-tech data-analysis tools.

*   Encyclopedia Pangalactica: Because you have access to the Encyclopedia Pangalactica, you gain +2 to creating advantages with Investigate if the object of your investigation is important enough to have an encyclopedia entry.
*   Full-Spectrum Signal Analyzer: Because you have access to special equipment, you gain +2 to Investigate when overcoming difficulties associated with deciphering or interpreting possible communication signals.

### Lore

See _Fate Core_, page 114.

### Notice

Notice stunts represent alien abilities and mutations as well as advanced communications gear and sensors.

*   Handheld Scanner: Because you have access to special equipment, you gain +2 when creating advantages with Notice during an initial inspection of some area or scene.
*   Radio Sense: Because of a mutation that allows you to sense radio waves, you gain +2 to create advantages with Notice related to the electromagnetic radiation being given off by a point source.

### Physique

Physique stunts can reflect the physiological advantages accrued from alien, mutant, cyborg, and similar anatomical variations, as well as from survival equipment of different sorts.

*   Heavyworlder: Because you are native to a high-gee planet, you gain +2 to Physique to overcome or defend against the effects of high gravity, acceleration, and other g-forces that you may experience.
*   Rapid Regeneration: Because of your unique physiology, once per scene you may spend a fate point to immediately clear a mild consequence or reduce the severity of a moderate or severe consequence by one step. You may rename the consequence if appropriate.

### Provoke

Provoke stunts can reflect alien abilities and setting-defining social circumstances.

*   Bug-Eyed Monster: Because you are a freakish alien, you gain +2 to Provoke when creating advantages related to frightening or repulsing normal human beings and others with similar sensibilities.
*   Psychic Blast: Because of your psychic powers, you may use Provoke to attack any intelligent target, even if you are unable to communicate or otherwise interact with them. The target defends with Will.
*   The Death Sentence in Twelve Systems: Because of your notoriety in the demimonde, you gain +2 to Provoke when creating advantages among criminals, outlaws, and other denizens of the underworld.

### Rapport

As with Provoke, Rapport stunts can be used to reflect alien abilities and setting-defining social circumstances.

*   Imperial Facilitator: Because of the special trust the Imperator of the Galaxy has for you, you gain +2 to Rapport when overcoming an Imperial citizen’s reluctance to assist you in your duties.
*   Pheromonal Mimic: Because you can produce tailored pheromonal mixes, you may spend a fate point to gain +2 to Rapport against one target who shares your life-support environment. This bonus lasts until the end of the session. You may spend another fate point to change your target, but changing your target ends the bonus for your previous target.

### Resources

Resources stunts reflect unusual sources of wealth or economic influence as well as the effects of wealth accumulation.

*   Galactic Line of Credit: Whenever you are compelled because of your financial needs or economic circumstances, you gain an extra fate point.
*   Cash Reserves: Once per session, when you are compelled because of your financial needs or economic circumstances, you may reject the compel without paying a fate point.
*   Trader to the Stars: After you use Resources to create advantages that represent the acquisition of trade goods or valuable commodities, you may trade any unused free invocations on those advantages for fate points, one to one, but you must do so at a market for those goods. However, at the end of a session, you lose any fate points you have above your refresh. Note that others do not lose any excess accrued fate points, reflecting the volatility of the market.
*   All the Way to the Bank: At the end of a session, if you have three or more fate points in excess of your refresh, you may spend three fate points to increase your refresh by one. (GMs, as written this is a pretty powerful effect, so you may wish to slow advancement by setting the threshold for advancing to four, five, six, or even more excess fate points, depending on the circumstances of the campaign.)
*   Market Savvy: Because you are a master of buying low and selling high, whenever you use Resources to create an advantage that represents the acquisition of trade goods or valuable commodities, a success counts as a success with style.

### Shoot

Shoot stunts may reflect special training or experience as well as devices such as scopes, sights, and special ammunition. Firearms may be represented by special rules, such as the Weapon ratings described in _Fate Core_ (page 277) and the alternatives described in the _Fate System Toolkit_ (pages 70-72).

*   L-5 Colony Windage: Because you are experienced in correcting for the effects of being inside rotating cylindrical habitats and similar places, you can attack with Shoot with no increase in difficulty due to Coriolis force, as described in “Microgravity”.

### Stealth

Stealth stunts may reflect alien, mutant, or cyborg capabilities as well as technological devices such as cloaking devices and stealth sheathing.

*   Camouflage Circuit: Because you have a suit with a light-bending fiber-optic lattice, you may spend a fate point to remove yourself from the scene. You may later reintroduce yourself to the scene in any place that you could have reached while you were out of sight, even interrupting another’s action to do so. If you didn’t act during the exchange in which you vanished, you may act immediately. Otherwise, you simply reappear and will act during the next exchange.
*   Prana Bindu Training: Because you have been trained in a graceful and subtle martial art, you may defend with Stealth against Fight attacks as long as you have suffered no stress or consequences in the current conflict.

### Will

Will stunts may reflect alien, mutant, or cyborg capabilities as well as technological devices such as cybernetic memory or psionics.

*   Alien Mindset: Because your alien physiology makes you quite emotionally stable, you gain +2 to defend with Will against efforts to move or persuade you with emotional appeals, particularly those that try to “get your goat” or “get under your skin.”
*   Psychic Blast: Because of your psychic powers, you may attack with Will. The target must be able to perceive your gaze.
*   Total Recall: Because you have a library of data implanted in your skull, you gain +2 to Will when overcoming obstacles involving memory (_Fate Core_, page 127).

## Extras

Extras in a science fiction game can be particularly useful for representing special abilities, advanced technology, spaceships, and star-spanning organizations that can affect play. When designing a setting, look to extras as the way to portray things that make the setting unique. _Fate Core_ (page 269) gives lots of guidance about creating extras.

### High Technology

High technology can be an extra that allows players to gain stunts representing weapons or tools that might not be generally available, such as a blaster from a higher-tech world, illegal neuro-mods that allow the user to read surface thoughts of those around her, a universal language translator (in a game where language differences are an obstacle), an alien serum that provokes rapid healing, or a personal, portable spacesuit. An extra representing an object can always be compelled to be stolen, borrowed, misappropriated, or otherwise taken out of the character’s hands, at least temporarily.

#### Tech Level

Technological artifacts can be assigned a **tech level**, an aspect that reflects its relative technological or scientific sophistication. When used against more primitive artifacts, the more sophisticated artifact grants its user an advantage with one free invocation per scene, or two free invocations if the tech level difference is three or more.

</table>

The tech level also represents a difficulty—with Primitive equivalent to Mediocre (+0) and Incomprehensible equivalent to Fantastic (+6)—against attempts to overcome defenses operating at that level of technological sophistication.

Tech level can also be used to define the **effect floor** or **effect ceiling**—in other words, the minimum (on a successful attack or overcome action) or maximum (on a successful defend action) number of shifts of effect possible when using an artifact for its intended purpose. In general, effect ceilings (defenses) trump effect floors (attacks) unless the attacker succeeds with style, in which case the ceiling is ignored. Effect floors and ceilings are described more in the _Fate System Toolkit_ (page 70).

#### Tool Classes

You can apply tech levels, described in the previous section, to specific types of artifacts, creating **tool** **classes** to systematize how a given piece of technology affects individual actions. Instead of having a single tech level that defines the effectiveness of all equipment produced by a society or culture, you can separate its different types of tools—its guns, armor, power sources, communicators, and so forth—into different tech levels.

*   Armor: Personal protective gear can be given an Armor rating* or damage ceiling.** Generally, armor protects against physical attacks, but certain kinds of drugs or hypno-conditioning might be available to protect against mental or social attacks.
*   Communicators: Equipment for transmitting and receiving messages allows for characters to interact. If you wish to reflect the issues of using communications technology with limited bandwidth that lacks immediacy and presence, you can give the device an effect ceiling that restricts the maximum shifts of its result when you use it to act with Rapport, Provoke, Deceive, and other interpersonal skills. Operating communicators to reach distant stations or penetrate jamming may require overcoming with Lore, with the device’s rating acting as the effect floor. Jamming is technically a defend action, and may require specialized equipment.
*   Firearms: Ranged weapons used with Shoot can be given a Weapon rating* or damage floor.**
*   Hand Weapons: Melee weapons used with Fight can be given a Weapon rating* or damage floor.**
*   Heavy Weapons: Artillery and other ranged weapons used with a skill other than Shoot that reflects technical expertise, such as Crafts (Engineering), can be given a Weapon rating* or damage floor.**
*   Mobility: Jetpacks, grav skates, personal ornithopters, hoverbikes, and similar devices. Define a given mobility device according to its relevant skill, which may be Athletics, Lore, Drive, Spacehand, or Crafts. You can give it an effect floor that establishes the minimum number of zones it allows the user to cross on a successful overcome action. Certain devices are designed for particular environments or circumstances—ice, water, space (zero-gee), paved surfaces, and so forth. Countermobility devices may be used to establish barriers that make crossing zone boundaries more difficult.
*   Power Sources: Batteries, capacitors, fuel cells, turbines, and other power sources can be treated as pools of fate points available for invoking aspects related to the things they power. In essence, the power source consists of a high concept, such as **Antimatter Reactor Core**, and a refresh rating.
*   Sensors: Scanning devices, analyzers, and similar equipment used in Notice or Investigate actions. Use the device’s rating as an effect floor for the shifts of result, indicating the range and sensitivity of the device. Successful use typically creates an advantage related to characteristics of the object of the scan or conditions in the scanned environment.
*   Spacesuits: Personal life-support systems to protect spacers from vacuum conditions, including low pressure, lack of breathable air, and the difficulty in disposing waste heat—cooling systems are important in space. If the suit is particularly cumbersome, you can use its rating as an effect ceiling for overcome actions with Athletics. As spacesuit technology improves, it provides extended duration, better protection from radiation, and greater ease of use. More sophisticated models will include built-in armor, sensors and communicators, mobility devices, and possibly even weapons.

> In a setting where modern-day humans have to deal with aliens in UFOs, the humans’ gunpowder-using _guns_ and _artillery_ are each treated as a **Primitive** (+0) tool class, while the aliens’ _energy blasters_ are **Conventional** (+3) and their _hypercannons_ are **Bleeding-Edge** (+5).

> In play, characters use Shoot to fire guns and blasters and a setting-specific Heavy Weapons skill to operate artillery and hypercannons, but those using an alien weapon get to use its tech level bonus as a weapon rating, adding to the shifts of effect of a successful attack. The humans will have to get to work developing armor to protect themselves!

Alternately, the effectiveness of a tool class available to a character can be treated as an extra, with the shifts of effect for a tool class determined by the number of stunts spent to gain access to the device by the character, one stunt giving two shifts of effect, two stunts giving four shifts of effect, and so on.

> In a setting where aliens from across the galaxy participate in an interstellar grand prix, PCs spend stunts to build their ships as technology. One ship may have an Advanced (+4) engine (2 stunts) but Old-Fashioned (+2) sensors (1 stunt), while another may have an Incomprehensible (+6) propulsion system (3 stunts) that puts the rest of the field to shame. In this setting, a ship’s technology sets an effect floor for the use of a character skill; any success with Pilot, for example, will be at least as effective as the tech level of the propulsion system.

##### Extra: Cold Fusion Cell

Permissions: Access to a cold fusion cell.

Cost: None.

Effect: You have access to a cheap and reliable **Cold Fusion Cell** with a refresh of 2\. Its fate points can be spent to invoke aspects related to channeling power to connected technological artifacts. Its power output can be manipulated with Lore, creating advantages such as **More Power!**

##### Extra: Near-Future EVA Suit

Permissions: Access to a functioning EVA suit.

Cost: None.

Effect: You are wearing a specially equipped Extra-Vehicular Activity Suit suitable for extended spacewalks. It protects against threats related to exposure to vacuum, with a Good (+3) Duration of several hours, and Fair (+2) Mobility in zero-gravity with its built-in thrusters. It has only an Average (+1) Communicator, a voice-only link with a controller back inside the ship.

### Military, Naval, or Official Rank

In settings where characters might be serving in some official capacity as part of a more or less hierarchical organization, and want to be able to use that authority, the Rank skill can be a useful extra. Characters who have an aspect specifying their rank, title, or position gain access to the Rank skill as an extra.

Military organizations are frequently divided into enlisted and commissioned (or “officer”) ranks. Lower enlisted ranks are the rank and file of the organization; senior enlisted ranks are noncommissioned officers with technical, administrative, and day-to-day supervisory expertise and responsibility. Officer ranks tend to be charged with command, planning, and organizational management.

There are, of course, other hierarchies to which a character may belong: an order of space knights, perhaps, or the diplomatic corps of a star-spanning regime, or even the management of an interstellar trading company.

#### Far-Future Space Navy Ranks

Enlisted: Astronaut Recruit, Astronaut 4th Class, Astronaut 3rd Class, Astronaut 2nd Class, Astronaut 1st Class, Assistant Chief Astronaut, Chief Astronaut, Senior Chief Astronaut, Master Chief Astronaut

Officer: Ensign, Junior Lieutenant, Lieutenant, Lieutenant Commander, Commander, Captain, Commodore, Admiral, Fleet Admiral

In the Space Navy, a lieutenant may command a gunboat (a small, expendable attack ship), a commander a frigate (a large, versatile ship of the line), and a captain a dreadnought (a huge, heavily armed and armored spaceship that sacrifices some speed for power and resilience). Senior enlisted personnel lead crew sections devoted to particular ship functions and duties, at higher levels forming a parallel chain of command that advises the corresponding officer rank. It’s the Navy, but in space.

### Alien Abilities

Alien abilities can be handled in several ways, depending on the prevalence of aliens in your setting and whether or not PCs will be playing alien species.

In settings where only NPCs will be aliens, the GM can define alien abilities on a case-by-case basis without too much regard for character balance or similar factors.

> The Grimaldons are an alien race whose individuals have **No Sense of Self**, and so are easily indoctrinated by megalomaniacal would-be galactic conquerors; on their long-vanished home world, they had established a collectivist utopia of altruism and peace. The GM mandates that all Grimaldons have Terrible (-2) Will on their own but also have the Collective Purpose stunt.

> Collective Purpose: Because you have imprinted upon your mind the collective purpose of a group or leader, whenever you could defend or overcome with Will to stay committed to that purpose, you can spend a fate point to tie your opposition, no roll required. You may spend a second fate point to succeed, and a third fate point to succeed with style.

In other settings, most PCs will be human but one or two players may want to be alien instead. In this instance, you can make the set of alien stunts and skills into an extra for characters who have an aspect that refers to their alien heritage.

> In a game about humanity’s first wave of expansion through the galaxy, a player wants to play an alien from a species that was largely wiped out after its contact with humanity, one of the lonely last survivors of its race. He wants his character, because of its alien perspective, to be really good at interacting with other aliens, so the GM allows him to take ranks in Encounter, which is not otherwise on the skill list for this setting.

Finally, in a setting where _everyone_ is at least potentially an alien, you don’t need an extra to highlight a character’s alien nature. In such cases, a player could make a character with an alien-related high concept or a specific **alien species aspect**, and then identify one to three **alien invocations** that refer to the character’s special nonhuman talents and establish typical ways in which the character’s alien aspect can be invoked. The GM may similarly add one to three typical **alien compels** that establish ways that the character’s alien aspect can be compelled. The GM and player may need to negotiate a bit to create a mutually satisfying suite of alien skills.

> In this game, the characters are among a multi-species legion of pangalactic patrol officers. A player decides to create a character who is a **High-Flying Balloon Creature from a Jupiter-Like Gas Giant**. This alien nature might be invoked to zoom for short bursts at high speed via a jet of gas or to float unnoticeably high in the atmosphere, and might be compelled to need more gas after a period of activity and movement.

The GM may define alien species similarly; alien compels can be either discovered by the characters gathering information in-character or created by the players collaborating out-of-character. The first method is appropriate for a game involving first encounters with aliens; the second, for a game that takes place in a “cosmopolitan” setting filled with a number of alien kindreds supposed to be already well-known to each other.

##### Wellsian Martian

These are the Martians from H. G. Wells’s _War of the Worlds_. They are octopoid, with overdeveloped brains in leathery brain-cases and underdeveloped physical capabilities. They subsist on a diet of blood transfused from slave species, and operate advanced machinery with astounding capabilities.

*   Alien Invocations: To communicate telepathically over great distances or to many minds; to possess a vast, cool, and unsympathetic intelligence.
*   Alien Compels: To be sluggish in Earth’s gravity; to be vulnerable to terrestrial disease and microorganisms.

### Psychic Powers

Psychic powers can be handled just like alien skills, with players and GMs collaborating to determine the ways in which a character’s suite of psychic powers can be invoked and compelled. Alternately, having psychic powers might provide access to the Psionics skill or to a psychic stunt such as _Psionic Attack: You can use Will to make mental attacks_. In a setting where psychic powers are common, the Psionics skill might be available to all characters, while in a setting where they are rare, the skill should be an extra, requiring a relevant aspect and a dedicated stunt.

# Spacecraft and Space Travel

This is the chapter that you’ve been waiting for, the one on space travel. How are you going to handle spaceships, space travel, and space combat in your Fate Space game? This is a big deal, because it’s what makes the game one of space adventure.

The principles of Fate still apply to the rules for space travel: they should showcase the characters as proactive, capable people leading dramatic lives. So rather than _systematizing_ space travel, our concern is _dramatizing_ it.

*   Low-plausibility space travel is what you see in _Star Wars_ and similar space fantasy. Technological black boxes let us just hop in and go, without much concern for the physical laws governing real-world space travel. It’s all about feel, and often it feels like something else: WWII dogfights and bombing runs, or WWI naval combat, or even swashbuckling on 17th-century ships of the line.
*   Medium-plausibility space travel is mostly what you get in _Star Trek_ or _Battlestar Galactica_. Certain dramatically interesting constraints based on real-world conditions are maintained throughout the fiction, but they are only taken so far. The choice of technologies creates the feel of the setting: one might have teleporters and matter transmuters; another might have gravity weapons and warp-capable fighters.
*   High-plausibility space travel is the province of _The Martian_ or _The Expanse_. Real-world constraints are adopted and used to shape the setting as well as constrain actions and choices. A character who wins usually does so because they understand how the universe works.

## The Space Map

One of the pleasures of a space adventure game is getting to decide where to go, to pull up stakes and head off to the far reaches of the galaxy if you want. Until someone takes the time and effort to figure out what’s at a given location, though, it literally _doesn’t exist!_ That said, limiting the characters takes away from the feeling that “you can go anywhere,” which is one strong appeal of roleplaying.

So it’s useful to draw up a space map to allow players to visualize the destinations available to them and the relationships among those places in distance and position. It’s hard to overstate the richness of a map in displaying these relationships. We’ll discuss three ways of doing this: a node map, a zone map, or an open map.

### Node Map

A node map shows the pieces of the setting as points connected by paths. Given an appropriate mode of transportation, characters can travel from their current node to any other node linked to it by a path. You can presume that all paths require the same time or effort to travel, or you can give each path a length that determines its travel time or effort. This space map is perfect for star systems connected by wormholes or hyperspace jump lines, but it can also be used for maps of normal space, with lines connecting those systems that are in range of each other for the typical starships of the setting. Systems that are _not_ connected are presumed to be sufficiently distant in normal space that the typical starship can’t reach from one to the other due to lack of fuel capacity, power reserves, or other measure of endurance.

A node map can also represent interplanetary space, such as in _Mass Drivers_, a gritty near-future setting focused on the Asteroid Belt. In _Mass Drivers_, each node of its space map represents the current orbital location of one or more constantly moving asteroids. When a spaceship’s crew plots a course to another asteroid or other destination, the GM indicates the destination’s current location by pointing to the node it occupies. Each path represents a distance of about 100,000 kilometers.

### Zone Map

A zone map breaks the setting into zones, regions, or areas, and assumes that movement within a zone is more-or-less trivial but that movement between zones requires some effort. For example, the map from <span>Pax Galactica divides a galaxy-wide space empire into zones. A zone map is topologically equivalent to a node map, but while a node map gives the feeling of leaving one location and traveling to another across an intervening distance, the zone map gives the feeling of occupying a particular volume of space and crossing a border into a different one—for example, “We’ve entered the Neutral Zone!”</span>

You can flesh out the zones—or the nodes on the node map, for that matter—by adding aspects. For example, in the galaxy zone map for _Pax Galactica_, the Galactic Core is densely packed with **Mostly Planetless** stars surrounding a **Massive Black Hole** and thus **Bathed in Deadly Radiation**, while the Outer Margins and the two Rifts are **Thinly Populated with Stars**, although only the Outer Margins are a **Lawless Frontier**. The other zones are all **Civilized Space**.

Ultimately, the difference between the zone and node maps is cosmetic. They work in essentially the same way, by indicating which locations are functionally adjacent. For locations that are _not adjacent_, any path between them requires transit across intermediate locations. Of course, with a zone map the route between any given pair of zones may not be limited to their common boundaries; in other words, a hyperspace path may in fact connect a world in the Sagittarius Arm with one in the Outer Margins, for example, allowing passage to and fro without passing through the intervening zones.

### Open Map

An open map, unlike the other space maps, places no hard restrictions on movement. This map is simply a graphic representation of a volume of space without any superimposed movement grid. Given an appropriate mode of transportation, characters can travel to anywhere on the map, calculating their travel time based on real-world considerations and the fictional capabilities of their vehicles. Both _Millennials_ and _The Gods Know Future Things_ use open maps.

If you want to play a game with very high plausibility, you can easily find astronomical data online that can be useful in creating bespoke three-dimensional star maps. The map of near space in _The Gods Know Future Things_ uses real-world astronomical data, but compresses them into two dimensions, so the distances among stars are more distorted the further one gets from Sol.

## Space Travel

As a game system, Fate doesn’t simulate the physics of the game universe. Instead, it relies on the players and GM to estimate the chance of success and failure by judging countervailing forces—attack and defense, speed and distance, stealth and alertness, and so forth—roll the dice, and then interpret the result together at the table.

This philosophy works best when people at the table have a strong sense of how things work in the fiction. So, knowing a little background about the physical details of space travel will help. To help with this, the following sections introduce some scientific vocabulary for space adventure, and provide information that will help GMs add verisimilitude to the game.

### A Little Bit of Rocket Science

Let’s talk about rocket science for a little bit. Rockets work by virtue of Newton’s third law: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Throw some mass out of the back of your spacecraft—the reaction mass—and you go forward. The bigger the reaction mass, or the greater the energy with which you throw it, the more forceful your forward motion. With no friction or other countervailing forces to slow you down or bring you to a stop, once your spaceship starts to move, it will keep moving until it experiences other forces. Each time you throw stuff out the back, you accelerate a little more, so if you can do so over a long enough period of time, you can build up a pretty good head of steam.

**Thrust** is what rocket scientists call the force required to accelerate a spacecraft at a given rate. Thrust is measured in newtons, and one newton is the force required to accelerate one kilogram of matter at a rate of one meter per second squared (i.e., per second per second). A spacecraft with a high-thrust engine can accelerate quickly, while one with a low-thrust engine must accelerate slowly.

**Specific impulse** (_I_<sub>sp</sub>) is a measure of the efficiency of a rocket engine’s fuel use. A spacecraft engine with high specific impulse can accelerate for a longer period of time on a given mass of propellant than a spacecraft engine with a low specific impulse can.

Together, these two ideas are the main considerations in spacecraft engine design: how much force can you apply to get your spacecraft moving and to slow it down again, and how much fuel do you need to carry to reach a particular velocity?

The following table gives examples of various at-least-theoretical spacecraft engine technologies.

Together, thrust and specific impulse determine the total **delta-vee**, or change in velocity, available to a spacecraft. Space-mission planners talk about the “delta-vee budget” of the mission—how much energy the spaceship making the journey must expend in order to get from where it is to where it needs to be. The biggest part of any delta-vee budget is usually the launch from a planetary surface. If you’re starting from the surface of the Earth, you’ll need to expend a great deal of energy even to get to low Earth orbit (LEO). Once in orbit, however, getting anywhere will require much less energy, by at least an order of magnitude—although the further away the destination, the less practical a low-energy transfer orbit (the least energy-expensive trajectory between two planets) becomes, because of the time involved. But the limits have to do with the patience and durability of human travelers—how much food and other supplies they’ll need to bring along, how much radiation exposure they’ll suffer—rather than the physics of it.

In some cases, the launch from a planet’s surface can be a moment of high drama or techno-thriller style action. In other cases, it can be as routine as catching a flight at the airport, particularly if the planet has a skyhook, space elevator, or other surface-to-orbit transportation system. Generally, it will take a high-thrust, high-specific-impulse engine to get a spaceship with a crew of PCs into orbit without booster stages, a piggyback to higher altitude on a suborbital craft, or other assistance. This detail can be ignored if your craft is equipped with sufficiently advanced technology, such as antigravity or reactionless thrusters.

#### Low Thrust, Low Specific Impulse

Pressurized fluid can be used as a reaction mass; you’ve probably seen a toy water rocket pumped up and launched. These engines are not terribly forceful and not terribly efficient, and even with the most extreme sort of staging couldn’t be used to escape Earth’s gravity well and achieve orbit.

You wouldn’t design a rocket this way on purpose, but it’s got story potential. In Isaac Asimov’s short story _Marooned Off Vesta_, for example, a pair of astronauts in the Asteroid Belt save themselves from a slow death in outer space by poking a hole in their water tank and using the escaping fluid as reaction mass to slowly push themselves toward the safety of a nearby asteroid settlement. This is a low-tech contrivance, potentially useful for moving around in a low-gravity environment as an emergency expedient.

The same principle also applies to things like jettisoning cargo or other mass. Conceivably, such an expedient could be used to impart a very small force to a spacecraft. In Frederik Pohl’s novel _Gateway_, two spaceships—both trapped above the event horizon of a black hole—docked with each other and transferred all hands to one ship and then separated, boosting one ship away and the other deeper into the black hole’s gravity well.

#### High Thrust, Low Specific Impulse

Such engines are capable of relatively rapid acceleration, but carry a lot of fuel in proportion to their payload. Often, lifting a heavier payload out of a planetary gravity well and into orbit requires **staging**, which is simply the use of disposable booster rockets comprised only of fuel tonnage, the engine itself, and whatever structural support is needed. **Chemical rockets** use either ignitable solid fuel or combustible mixed-liquid fuel; solid-fuel rockets use up all their fuel in one burn, while liquid fuel rockets can be turned off or even throttled for variable thrust.

Additionally, there are various sorts of atomic-powered rockets; for example, **nuclear thermal rockets** expose a “working fluid” of low-mass particles like hydrogen atoms to the heat of a nuclear reaction and then expel the exhaust as an energetic reaction mass. These are by some accounts about twice as efficient as chemical rockets, but the most efficient of such engines produce highly radioactive exhaust in their wake, making them unsuitable for use in an atmosphere one cares about.

A typical mission profile for this sort of rocket involves an initial burn (the application of thrust) followed by a long period of coasting, followed by a decelerating burn to match velocity with or enter orbit around the destination. Intermediate, course-correcting burns may also be applied. In many cases, the spacecraft can use an intermediate planet for a **gravity assist** or **slingshot maneuver**, accelerating as a result of the planet’s gravity well as it speeds past. Likewise, the craft can decelerate via **aerobraking** by using a planet’s atmosphere, like a stone skipping across the water, but this causes significant structural strain.

#### Low Thrust, High Specific Impulse

In contrast to chemical and atomic rockets, which burn fuel rapidly during brief intervals of high acceleration, some spacecraft rockets will thrust slowly but steadily, building up momentum over long periods of time and then decelerating slowly as well. For example, an **ion drive** uses an electric field to accelerate charged particles—usually ions of a noble gas such as xenon or argon—as the reaction mass. This drive, however, cannot be used in atmosphere because the presence of other particles apparently interferes with its operation.

Although not technically rockets, **lightsails** can be included in this category because their fuel use amounts to zero and their thrust is microscopic. Instead of burning fuel, a lightsail uses photon pressure against its enormous but low-mass reflective surface to gain very small but continuous acceleration. Lightsails that rely only on light from the Sun are called “solar sails,” and in the Solar System they are most effective inside the orbit of Mars. Further out, a lightsail would need to be pushed by a beam from a large laser; a large enough battery of lasers could potentially propel an interstellar probe.

These sorts of spacecraft take a long time to reach their destinations compared to high-thrust vessels, but their low rate of fuel consumption means they are often better for long-distance journeys where an engine with low specific impulse would run out of fuel.

#### High Thrust, High Specific Impulse

These sorts of engines are capable of long burns at high acceleration. A **fusion torch** relies on hydrogen fusion to create high-velocity exhaust to accelerate continuously to the midway point, then reverses its orientation and decelerates continuously until it arrives at its destination, all other things being equal. A torchship’s exhaust is extremely hot and viciously radioactive, making it a dangerous weapon at close quarters—this was the “Kzinti lesson” in the Larry Niven short story _The Warriors_, where a warlike alien race with reactionless thrusters runs into pacifistic but quick-thinking human beings traveling via fusion torch. A **Bussard ramje****t** uses an electromagnetic scoop to gather hydrogen atoms floating in interstellar space to power its fusion engine, although it does have to accelerate to scooping speeds by other means and do something to ionize the hydrogen so that it can be scooped up. And since there may not be as much hydrogen floating around in interstellar space as was once thought, for this to work interstellar societies may need to “seed” the spacelanes with deuterium.

This category also includes high technology low- and medium-plausibility “reactionless thrusters,” “impulse drives,” and the like that propel a ship without expelling reaction mass. Adding in acceleration compensation fields or artificial gravity plates enables spacecraft to perform impossible-seeming maneuvers, like accelerating at high gravity continuously or changing direction almost instantaneously. At very high technology levels, even the most advanced torchship might comparatively seem as if it were standing still.

### Interplanetary Travel

During play, the biggest question about interplanetary travel is usually how long it takes to reach a destination. Without more specific information, you can use the following chart as a rough guide to travel time, based on the type of thruster used and the distance involved. If the goal is merely to cross paths with or fly by the target, the time required is considerably shorter, since no deceleration or matching of velocities is required.

If travel time is an important issue, players can often use Engineering or Science to create advantages that can be invoked when overcoming with Astrogation or Pilot to plot and execute the course. Succeeding with style can reduce the travel time by one step (_Fate Core_, page 197), and succeeding at a cost can increase travel time by one or more steps or prompt the need for additional fuel. Complete failure means that the trip is impossible; the ship lacks the delta-vee needed to make the trip.

Close Approach: Travel to a nearby interplanetary destination, such as a planetary satellite (Earth to the Moon, Europa to Ganymede) or an L-5 space colony (a space station at a gravitationally stable interplanetary coordinate).

Interplanetary: Travel to another planet under relatively favorable conditions—orbital proximity, matching velocities, and so forth. Earth to Mars or Venus will usually fall into this category.

Extreme Interplanetary: Travel to another planet under more extreme circumstances. This includes reaching the outer planets of a solar system or trying to match velocities with a rapidly moving destination. Earth to Jupiter or Saturn will usually fall into this category. For greater distances, increase the travel time accordingly, noting that a high-specific-impulse craft will scale up travel time more slowly than a low-specific-impulse craft within the limits of the former craft’s fuel supply, since its ability to accelerate over longer periods of time lets it go faster.

### Interstellar Travel at Relativistic Speeds

Einstein’s principle of relativity means that as a spacecraft approaches the speed of light, it will experience **relativistic effects**. In your game, the most important implication of relativistic effects is that time aboard a moving spacecraft will pass more slowly than it will to an observer at rest with respect to the vessel.

Relativistic effects might be an important and intriguing conceit for your setting—for example, if you’re playing a game loosely based on Joe Haldeman’s _The Forever War_ where interstellar soldier PCs come back for R&R to an Earth that is increasingly alien to them because of the time elapsed in interstellar travel, and where they find themselves dealing with an increasingly technologically sophisticated enemy as they get closer and closer to the alien homeworld.

Alternately, you may need to incorporate relativistic effects as an element of an otherwise typical sci-fi setting. For example, the PCs may find themselves trapped on a primitive world and have to make a desperate subluminal bid to return to FTL starfaring civilization. In such a case, the following table* may be helpful. It maps speed as a fraction of the speed of light (_c_) to the Fate ladder, and lists the elapsed times for those aboard the spacecraft and those back home as a function of the distance in light-years that the ship travels.

</table>

> * This table is an oversimplification, given that it does not worry about the time needed for acceleration or deceleration. Also, for game purposes, relativistic effects don’t really kick in until the ship passes .5_c_, even though physicists consider an object moving at .15_c_ or above to be experiencing noticeable relativistic effects.

So, for example, an interstellar spacecraft capable of achieving nine-tenths of the speed of light—traveling at Superb (+5) speed—travels for a hundred light-years at its cruising velocity. Aboard the ship, it will seem as if about fifty years have passed (“several decades” or “half a century” in Fate terms). Meanwhile, to those who sent the ship on its way, it will seem as if 110 years have passed before the ship covers those hundred light-years—over twice as long!

Add in life-extending technology like cryosleep or stasis fields for the travelers, and you’ll find that each time an interstellar spacecraft arrives at a world it has visited previously, radical changes may have taken place. In such a game, each interstellar mission might be a significant or major milestone, changing both the game universe and the characters.

### Faster-than-Light (FTL) Travel

Faster-than-light travel is one implausibility that science fiction readers are quick to forgive, since we need it to get us to where the action is. Of course, physicists are hard at work trying to come up with ways to defy the laws of physics and get us to the stars for real. Here are some typical science-fictional methods of traveling faster than light.

#### Hyperspace

In hyperspace travel, a starship leaves normal space and enters a higher-order space with different physical laws but which spatially corresponds one-to-one to normal space. Once in hyperspace, a ship typically no longer needs its hyperdrive, so it activates a separate propulsion source, which may or may not be its normal space drives. Alternately, a ship may move within hyperspace along a vector determined by its velocity and heading when it left normal space; arriving at the desired location is then a matter of turning off the hyperspace field generator at the correct moment.

If the spaceship’s sensors do not reach into normal space from hyperspace, it may be risky to re-enter normal space close to a planetary surface or anywhere else where normal matter may be present in sufficient quantity or density. Hyperspace may be featureless or may contain obstacles and hazards that must be avoided or evaded. It may even be occupied by alien entities, some of whom may be hostile to human life.

To use hyperspace in a game, think about the following questions:

*   What kinds of FTL speeds can a starship travel at in hyperspace?
*   How does hyperspace affect human beings physically and psychologically? Does it have the same effect on various alien beings?
*   Are there obstacles or hazards in hyperspace? How can these be detected or avoided?
*   Can people in hyperspace see into normal space? Can people in normal space see into hyperspace?
*   Does time in hyperspace pass at the same rate as time in normal space?
*   What happens if something leaves the ship while it is in hyperspace? Does it pop back into normal space or remain lost in the void of hyperspace? More generally, does it take energy to keep the ship in hyperspace, or does it take energy to bring the ship out of hyperspace once it reaches its destination?
*   How hard is it to successfully calculate a path through hyperspace to a destination? How big is the normal margin of error?
*   How large does the hyperspace field generator need to be, relative to the starship? In other words, do starships need to be markedly larger than interplanetary vessels? Do they need to be significantly smaller?
*   How much additional fuel does the field generator require to activate or operate?
*   Can signals be sent through hyperspace?

##### Example Hyperspace Drive: The Wang-Chaudary Vortex Drive

The Wang-Chaudary Vortex Drive causes a ship to enter a dimensionless space where it exists as a sort of standing wave. The activation of the drive is accompanied by a **Burst of Gravity Waves** that can be destructive to nearby objects, and nearby gravity wells add to the complexity of the calculations needed to “plot a course” through V-Space. Typically, the drive is only activated in interplanetary space at the margins of a star system, where space-time is relatively flat, so reaching a safe distance typically requires a **Months-Long Journey Out**.

The Wang-Chaudary drive requires **Enormous Energy Inputs** and is typically powered by a dedicated **Antimatter Reactor**. The reactor is fueled with very expensive, specially made **Antimatter Containment Bottles** manufactured at large, well-guarded industrial complexes and available for purchase at starship docking facilities. (These bottles make for great MacGuffins.)

Prior to entering V-Space, the navigator calculates the necessary amplitude and frequency of the drive-wave; it takes more energy to remain close to the point of origin, making the V-Drive useful only at interstellar distances. Simultaneous translation, so that the ship appears at its destination at the moment it disappears from its origin, requires the lowest energy input, but navigation errors and engineering failures have been known to throw ships far into the past or future at locations far from the intended destination.

Once in V-Space, the ship is essentially **Coterminous with All Time and Space**. Passengers experience V-Space as a **Brief Period of Disembodied Sensory Deprivation** sometimes accompanied by **Unpleasant Auditory and Visual Hallucinat****ions**.

While intergalactic travel is theoretically possible via the transdimensional vortex, in practice the error margins at those ranges are too great for reliable transit. A number of interesting and strange space-going cultures are said to be the product of errant V-Drive colony ships emerging in the distant past at the far reaches of the universe.

#### Space Warp

Warp drive involves folding or otherwise manipulating normal space so that the ship can cross interstellar space as if the distances involved were much shorter than normal. A warp ship never leaves normal space, but is moving at superluminal speeds. Distortions at the interface between warpspace and normal space affect the precision of these observations, and plotted courses must avoid significant gravity fields.

Questions to address include the following:

*   How powerful is the warp effect? What effective rates of travel does it permit?
*   Does the warp effect produce movement in and of itself, or must the ship maneuver through the folded space using conventional means?
*   What happens when two warp fields overlap?
*   How much fuel does the warp engine require?
*   Does the warp field work at full strength within a star system or close to a planetary mass?

##### Example Warp Drive: The Millennium Drive

This drive enabled human beings to make use of a warp network created and maintained by a multi-species galactic confederation. Ships make **warp transits** when their warp engines interact with the warp fields created by confederation **waystations**. A ship can create a space warp if there is a waystation within a few light-years of the ship’s warp initiation point.

Warp sensors can detect ships moving in warp via quantum vibrations that have not as of yet been harnessed for communication. When two warp fields meet, they interfere with one another, sending both ships off on a new vector in a combined or shared field. This means that interception is possible, and even a failed interception can slow or strand the target ship.

For this drive, the approximate travel time is a time increment based on the travel distance, modified with steps of “half,” “one,” “a few,” or “several,” as in _Fate Core_. So, a hop of 80 light-years takes either several hours or about a day, while a 1,000 light-year trip takes about a week, and a 35,000 light-year journey takes a few months.

The warp drive is experimental for human beings, so using it requires the crew of a human warpship to succeed at two actions: powering up the warp drive using Engineering, and reaching the desired location using Pilot. A crew member can use Astrogation to create an advantage for the engineer or the pilot, or for both on a success with style.

Failing the Engineering action can mean damage to the ship due to power surges and equipment overloads, control difficulties for the pilot, or similar problems.

Failing the Pilot action can mean delays, navigation errors, or encounters with threats or hazards that a more skillful pilot might have avoided. The pilot has only a limited ability to affect the course of the starship, since it is in essence merely riding the space-time warp created when the drive was activated near the warp beacon.

The difficulty of a warp depends on the distance being covered. Round to the nearest power of ten. Anything above five light-years but below about 55 light-years is Average (+1) difficulty. The difficulty increases by one step per order of magnitude that the distance increases, so traveling a distance of 1,000 light-years faces Good (+3) difficulty while traveling a distance of 35,000 light-years faces Great (+4) difficulty. If a waystation is not sufficiently close, increase the difficulty or travel time.

#### Wormholes

Wormholes—which could be skinned as portals, stargates, or transit points—are pathways that connect distant points in space-time through a higher dimension. They can be thought of as a kind of hyperspace, but the endpoints of each hyperspace path are predetermined. Ships may be able to just enter the wormhole without special equipment, or a nearby control station may be needed to open the wormhole.

Questions to address include the following:

*   How are wormholes detected and accessed?
*   Does each wormhole connect only two endpoints or several?
*   Do wormholes allow travel in both directions or only in one, so that there are “entrance” and “exit” terminals in any given system?
*   Can a wormhole be located anywhere, or must it be near specific sorts of places, such as near a black hole?
*   How extensive is the wormhole network?
*   Are wormholes artificial or natural? If artificial, who maintains the wormholes? How do they determine whom they permit to use a wormhole?

##### A Wormhole Network

In the late 22nd century, high-energy physicists discovered a means to create artificial wormholes by using a negative-mass fluid. In a collaborative multinational effort along the lines of the Manhattan Project, a portal to the habitable exoplanet Proxima Centauri b was created in orbit around Earth, and a race to colonize Terranova began. The influx of resources through the wormhole from the planet and from a nearby planetoid belt initiated a new age of prosperity on Earth. The Autorité du Portail (AdP) was formed to build and maintain additional portals. Soon a network extending from Earth to other stars began to form.

A wormhole station appears as a gigantic spherical lattice that glows with the luminous blue energy of the negative-mass fluid that must be continuously powered in order to hold open the throat of the wormhole. The station creates a one-way link to a distant point that must be at least several light-years away, though greater distance requires more negative-mass fluid, to a practical maximum of perhaps a dozen light-years.

The AdP charges transit fees to ships using the portal network, using the funds to maintain and extend the network, and wormhole stations are generally regarded as neutral territory by the various factions that seek to exploit the resources of the star systems opened up by the network. The decision to open up a wormhole station is typically regarded as an investment, with the AdP relying on entrepreneurial types willing to pay for the construction of a return station out of the profits of their colonization and settlement efforts.

## Modes of Travel

This section will describe the three basic modes of space travel: mission-based, passage-based, and free or unrestricted travel. In your game, the modes available to the characters may differ over time and between given characters, especially if they get separated.

### Mission-Based Travel

The GM decides where the PCs are going and provides them with the means of getting there, whether that’s a one-way ticket on a space liner or a permanent billet on a military vessel under specific orders. In general, the players won’t have a lot of control over where their characters go, and they’ll expect that the GM will send them to interesting places where opportunities abound and adventure awaits!

This is a very common way of doing business, since it lets the GM focus on creating details for the current mission. Examples from science fiction literature and film are easy to come by.

##### It’s a Professional Career

There are many ways to bring a diverse group of PCs together for a space-based campaign.

*   Explorers: The PCs are scouts or surveyors, trained to travel to new worlds and assess them from a scientific, commercial, or military standpoint.
*   Mercenaries: The PCs are members of a mercenary company, seeking passage from one world to the next in order to hire on as soldiers for the various political leaders and organizations that come into conflict.
*   Salvage Crew: The PCs are space crew on a civilian ship, tasked to seek out and recover damaged vessels and lost cargo.
*   Space Fleet: The PCs are space crew on a military vessel, with duties relating to its combat and patrol operations.
*   Space Marines: The PCs are military personnel in the same outfit, space-going soldiers trained to conduct boarding operations, customs inspections, and planetary raids.
*   Space Merchants: The PCs are space crew on a merchant marine ship, traveling from world to world in order to buy low and sell high.

### Passage-Based Travel

The PCs have a menu of options about where to go, but they must secure passage one way or another aboard a vessel headed to their desired destination. In some settings, the PCs must actually design, finance, build, and launch a space-worthy vessel themselves! This provides greater freedom of movement and choice to the PCs while still allowing the GM to focus their prep on a relatively limited array of destinations.

In simplest form, a PC can secure passage to a new planet on a ship already headed that way by rolling, usually with Resources, against passive opposition based on the distance to the destination and its relative popularity.

_Pax Galactica_ uses a zone-based system of spacelanes to represent the various passenger and freight shipping lines that cover the galaxy.

#### The Launch as Drama

It may be the case that the PCs have one or more destinations available but must first engage in a challenge (_Fate Core_, page 147) to design, produce, and manufacture a spacecraft capable of reaching the destination they select. Similarly, while in many games getting into space is simply a background event, involving as little drama as a routine airplane take-off, your game could instead frame an adventure as an initial attempt to reach orbit, or as a marooned situation. In such games the launch of a spacecraft may be a dramatic point in the story, where one or both of these story questions may be at stake:

*   Did the engineers get their numbers right and build the thing properly?
*   Does the pilot have what it takes to get the thing into the air and keep it there?

The answer to the first question is provided by an Engineering action to overcome the technical challenges of design and construction. The difficulty can be set based on the mass of the launch vehicle, perhaps modified by the thrust of the engine. Failure indicates catastrophic loss of the craft and its payload, unless it is protected by some sort of abort-and-escape device, or may simply increase the difficulty to the Pilot action needed to reach orbit. The difficulty of the Pilot action depends on the engineer’s design skills and the amount of testing the launch system has undergone. An untried, untested prototype by competent but untested architects would justify Legendary (+8) difficulty, but rounds of testing, trials, and evaluation might reduce the difficulty, albeit increasing the time required to complete the system, as would a crack team of the brightest and best-trained minds the rocket academy can produce.

Additionally, an experimental launch may subject passengers and crew to stress or injury from the force of the acceleration, particularly if that force is not smoothly and steadily applied. You can even consider the launch to be an attack on its passengers, based on the relative thrust of the launch vehicle, defended against with Physique; protective technology such as acceleration couches, safety harnesses, and pressure suits will reduce the rating of the attack.

> The group has created a setting loosely based on Yevgeny Zamyatin’s novel _We_, in which a dystopian totalitarian society is focused on building a spaceship for the glorification of the State, mashed up with _Space: 1999_ or _Lost in Space_. The PCs are all members of the project team charged with constructing a vessel to be named the _Benefactor_, and will be aboard when it finally launches. The available destinations include a short trip to the sister planet that is supposedly home to a rival civilization, or a longer journey to the anomalous cometary object that is connected to ancient legends of the State’s origin.

> The GM frames the effort to build the ship as a challenge, requiring the characters to succeed at a number of linked efforts. These include (a) planning the space mission, (b) designing the ship, (c) requisitioning and securing the necessary materials, equipment, and personnel, (d) overseeing the construction, and (e) maintaining the security of the operation against saboteurs, dissidents, and reactionaries. The relevant setting-specific or setting-neutral skills for each task are Science (Lore), Engineering (Crafts), Bureaucracy (Rapport), and Investigation, respectively. Each step will only result in a success or success at a cost, since the whole point of the game is to get the PCs out into space aboard the _Benefactor_.

> The planning process defines the parameters of the mission: a journey to the benighted sister planet where the glory of the State is unknown, the first step toward the greater goal of extending the State’s benign influence throughout the Solar System. The _Benefactor_ should deliver a small team of the most loyal of the State’s minions (as citizens are unironically known) to the sister planet, where they will report back and then await further instructions from the State. The GM sets a difficulty for the overcome action with Science at the destination commensurate with the relatively modest ambitions of the planners.

> Depending on the result of each step, the GM will have a number of complications (in the form of invokable aspects) to use to cause trouble on the journey, including potential rivals, antagonists, and informers, design flaws and engineering problems, and bureaucratic snafus and tangles.

> When the PCs finish the _Benefactor_, the GM announces that they have reached a minor milestone (_Fate Core_, page 256). The players adjust their characters accordingly, and the journey begins!

### Free Travel

In this case, players have access to a ship—or ships!—and can choose where they want to go, within the limits of their spacefaring technology and space map. They are on their own hook, and the galaxy (or at least the Solar System) is theirs to explore! This gives players maximum freedom, but the GM must be ready to improvise and to have procedures available for quickly generating coherent and interesting setting details as well as exciting and meaningful challenges and adventure opportunities should the players go off in unanticipated directions, as they are wont to do. Free travel is very challenging for the GM but may also be very satisfying for the players and rewarding to run.

## Life in Space

Fate is a narration-intensive game, and enjoyable play relies much on offering interesting and compelling challenges as well as plausible and dramatic consequences, of which space has plenty. To paraphrase Raymond Chandler: when in doubt, send in the laws of physics—radiation, acceleration forces, or explosive decompression. In a high-plausibility game, the characters might also have to worry about microgravity, so that the weight of a massive world becomes a bracing relief.

### Radiation

For most high-plausibility games as well as medium-plausibility near-future games, spaceship crews and passengers will need to be shielded from radiation exposure. Sources of radiation can include the following:

*   Solar flares and similar activity
*   Intense planetary radiation belts caused by powerful magnetospheres, like Jupiter’s
*   Oncoming cosmic particles that strike a rapidly moving ship
*   Any radiation caused by the ship’s own drives or power plant

Ships without powerful electromagnetic or gravitic shielding are almost certain to have radiation shelters into which passengers and crew can retreat if the ships are designed to operate in space for any extended period of time.

Direct exposure to radiation can be treated as an attack, defended against with Physique. Severe exposure can be debilitating, with effects such as skin burns, internal bleeding, and organ damage. Getting to shelter before receiving a lethal or debilitating radiation dose can be a roll with Athletics, Spacehand, or other appropriate crew skill, against a difficulty based on the severity of the storm and the distance to the shelter, which will probably be located at the core or center of the ship, behind layers of shielding.

Low-level radiation hazards can be treated as challenges, in which the characters must note dangerous dosimeter readings and radiation monitor levels (Notice), identify the precise source of the hazard (Investigate or Science), and address the problem (Engineering to create shielding or a patch, Science to provide medical treatment, etc.).

Radiation poisoning might be treated with “regular treatments in hyper sleep,” “nanobot radiation sweepers,” “pre-jump injections,” and so forth.

### Exposure to Vacuum

A spaceship hull might lose its integrity—becoming holed or suffering a hull breach—due to hostile fire, impact with one or more micrometeoroids, or structural weakness. Detecting and patching a slow leak is a challenge involving Notice and Engineering; rapid or explosive decompression could require Athletics to dodge spontaneous projectiles and Engineering to patch or otherwise remedy the defect. Sealing up one’s spacesuit in time with Engineering may prevent serious internal injuries. Injury from collisions with unsecured objects or bodies is another potential danger.

The loss of integrity to a spacecraft’s hull can result in unplanned, uncontrolled decompression as the ship’s air rushes or bleeds out into the vacuum. A rapid decrease in air pressure can cause lung damage or other pressure trauma (“barotrauma”) to the intestines, inner ear, and other internal cavities as well as decompression sickness, caused by dissolved gases forming bubbles inside the body. A pressure drop to vacuum can also swell the body to about twice its normal volume, unless it’s protected by a pressure suit. Note that holding one’s breath during an episode of rapid decompression is a big mistake, as it could cause a lung to rupture.

However, the most serious danger is lack of oxygen (“hypoxia”) causing loss of consciousness in about ten seconds and death after about a minute. Being tossed out an airlock without a spacesuit can have this effect.

### Acceleration

In the absence of artificial gravity or other super-science, a spacecraft’s crew and passengers feel its acceleration as a force pushing them back against the direction of travel. This acceleration can be measured in _gees_ or “gravities.” A steady one-gee acceleration is indistinguishable from the force of gravity at Earth’s surface. Rapid or erratic acceleration at high gees produces g-forces that put stress on a human body, causing temporary vision loss (partial or complete), loss of consciousness, permanent blindness, and even death. Passengers and crew may need to be strapped down or otherwise secured in “acceleration couches” or need to wear pressure suits that force blood back into the extremities.

More advanced gravity-affecting “inertial dampeners” or similar technologies may obviate the need for other forms of acceleration protection, but such tech is low plausibility. More plausible are acceleration tanks filled with some sort of oxygenated foam that surrounds the body and penetrates internal cavities.

To withstand high acceleration, a character must defend with Physique against a difficulty determined by the severity or suddenness of the acceleration, which can be established by the result of a Pilot roll or the ship engines’ relevant skill, whether Thrust, Drives, or Delta-vee. An astronaut’s or test pilot’s high-gee training can be represented as a Physique stunt. In general, protective technologies will account for normal acceleration; only call for rolls if complications emerge from other actions or as part of a challenge.

### Microgravity

Microgravity produces long-term effects such as muscle atrophy and bone-density loss. Such effects can be mitigated by a program of strenuous exercise, weight belts, and/or magnetic or high-traction shoes. Maintaining the appropriate regimen requires an Athletics roll against a difficulty determined by the duration of the space journey, with a few weeks being Average (+1). A tie causes a mild consequence, while failure causes a moderate or severe consequence related to bodily weakness.

Some spaceships provide artificial gravity by rotating around a long axis to produce a Coriolis force. This force also affects the apparent trajectories of ballistic objects, so that they seem to curve rather than travel in a straight line. This increases the difficulty of attacking with thrown weapons and projectiles, to the tune of an extra step of difficulty per zone of distance to the target; an Athletics or Shoot stunt can be used to offset the difficulty increase from the Coriolis force.

## Ship Ownership

If players want their characters to own a ship, you can handle this in one of three ways.

1\. Access to the ship is a story detail, probably defined by a situation aspect. PCs may be on a ship together, but who owns it and who pays to keep it running are not part of their identities. They could even lose access to the ship permanently. This method emphasizes how the characters get along in the universe.

> In _Pax Galactica_, the characters are citizens of the star-spanning Principate. They might begin the game together as passengers and crew aboard a space yacht, given to the highest-ranking citizen aboard, at least temporarily, as a **Gift from the Emperor**. When space pirates hijack the ship and take everyone onboard as hostages, it’s a case of easy come, easy go.

2\. Access to the ship is implied by a character aspect. **Hotshot Fighter Pilot**, for example, establishes facts about the universe (there are fighters), tells us something about this character (they’re a hotshot), and tells the GM that the player wants this fact to be part of the fate point economy—they want to often be more effective when piloting a fighter, but also more likely to get in trouble for being a spaceborne showoff. This method emphasizes how a character interacts with a type of ship.

> In _The High Frontiersmen_, the characters belong to either a U.S. or Soviet space agency, and so space-planes, rocketships, and shuttlecraft are available to characters depending on their assigned duties. An **Orbital Bomber Pilot** might be assigned to an orbital bombing station and called upon to perform orbital bombing missions—potentially suicidal ones!—with atomic weapons.

3\. Access to the ship is an extra. One or more players invests some of their character resources—whether stunts or refresh, skill ranks, or aspects—into a ship, making it part of the character, and any separation of character from the ship is temporary. This method emphasizes the character’s relationship with a specific ship as a part of their identity.

> In _Mass Drivers_, the characters are all members of the same asteroid freighter crew, and all have aspects describing their relationships with each other, with the ship itself, or both. This gives them access to and communal control of the freighter that they define together. The focus of the game stays on the ship, so if a character leaves the crew, generally their player will create a new crew member rather than following the original character. If the ship is damaged or destroyed, how it is fixed or replaced becomes a new story problem for the characters to solve.

## Statting Spaceships

Once you have a ship, what do you do with it? The answer will determine the complexity of rules you will need to represent it. Does anything even happen on the ship? If the ship is mainly used to transfer the characters from one adventure location to the next, then it may not need rules: “We hop in our corsair and take it to the base in the Outer Planets.” Many games work fine with no rules for the ship—each player imagines the bridge as they want; the GM can ask players where their characters are and what they are doing, but there is no need for shipboard actions to be spelled out.

If there’s a boarding party, though, you’ll probably need to make a map of zones, bulkheads, and important features. Likewise, if there’s a chance for combat between ships, you might need to model shields, shipboard weapons, and means of maneuvering. The desired level of abstraction exists in tension with the need for rules.

There are many ways a ship can be used, but these are the most important:

*   To Go Places: PCs need to get from one adventure location to another. The big rules questions here relate to how far and how fast travelers can go, and how much control they have over when they leave and where they end up. No rules may be needed, and there might not even be scenes on the ship.
*   To Get Into a Fight: Space combat is a major element in much of science fiction, particularly the sort of action-packed, cinematic sci-fi that Fate is well suited to emulate. Important rules questions include the details of attack, defense, and maneuver, as well as the specifics of detection, electronic warfare, and heat accumulation. Statistics for the ship may be needed, as the ship becomes a kind of character that the PCs control. The ship may also have a map of its interior zones.
*   To Work Hard and Live Dangerously: PCs will want to use their skills to keep the ship on course and in good repair. In space the most obvious environmental dangers are microgravity, vacuum, and radiation. For characters who live or work in space, these and other threats are occupational hazards. The relevant rules questions consider how to represent these features or, more precisely, how to represent the technology that protects characters from them. A map of the ship will be needed, with aspects that affect some zones and not others. The ship may also have detailed statistics that supplement or replace character abilities.

The way your spaceship is represented may change as circumstances in the campaign change, but you may want to lay out a standard procedure. This section gives some options, many of which can be combined as desired.

You’ll find detailed examples of different ways to stat spaceships in _Mass Drivers_ and _Pax Galactica_.

### As a Setting Element or Aspect

The presence of the ship in the scene enables particular skills to be used, such as Pilot, Gunnery, or Engineering—see the discussion of skills. The spaceship may be more-or-less completely defined by one aspect, much like a high concept, consisting of at least a ship type or model and, optionally, the ship’s name or other designation. Some examples include **Free Trader Beowulf**, **Federation Starship Enterprise**, and **Incom T-65 X-Wing Fighter**.

The ship’s capabilities are otherwise defined in fictional terms—for example, “A free trader is an interstellar freighter capable of carrying about a dozen passengers and several hundred tons of cargo through hyperspace on weeks-long journeys between ports of call, with limited defensive capabilities other than flight.” This may be all the information needed to run such a starship, at least to begin.

In play, having access to or control of the spaceship aspect allows players to use their characters’ skills to do things using the ship. Thus, a **Starfighter Pilot** needs access to a **Fighter Craft** to be able to go dogfight. Even if the character’s Pilot skill is Mediocre (+0) or lower, these two aspects allow the character to launch and attempt to intercept incoming bogies.

Note that “having a spaceship aspect” doesn’t mean it has to be one of the character’s aspects; it may simply be a matter of creating an advantage during play, such as “I go in and browbeat the flight officer to put me in a **Class-A Starfighter** instead of one of the beat-up old space-wrecks everyone else is flying,” to which the only appropriate response from the GM is “Roll Provoke.”

This method works well when the capabilities of various spacecraft are fairly well established, as when trying to emulate a particular fictional setting or genre, or if the game doesn’t focus on the details of specific ships.

### As Aspects

Extending the previous idea, a spaceship may be defined as a bundle of aspects, including a high concept, trouble, and some other aspects that often modify default assumptions about what spacecraft are capable of. Aspects like **Heavily Armed**, **Concealed Smuggling Compartments**, and **Bad Reputation in Alpha Sector** help to distinguish one ship from another and affect its capabilities.

Don’t make all of a ship’s aspects beneficial, though. Aspects that reflect the limitations of a ship will provide entertaining complications—for example, **Lightly Armored**, **Behemoth**, or **Held Together with Duct Tape**.

This method works well when the capabilities of specific types of spaceships have not been fully established in the fiction and when characters have a suite of skills for operating spaceships, such as Pilot, Engineering, and Gunnery.

### As Skills

Spaceships may have skills that are used instead of or in concert with character skills to accomplish actions in space. This method works well when the different capabilities of different ships are interesting and relevant, and is a good way to represent differences in scale between characters and spacecraft, particularly by giving different names to the character and ship skills. There are many different ways to implement this, as follows.

#### Ship Skills Replace Character Skills

A character with an aspect representing the right training or experience can use a relevant ship skill.

> In a setting where specialized training unlocks the capabilities of superior technology, a character must have the aspect **Galactic Weaponeer** to fire the ship’s Superb (+5) Space Weapons rather than using her own Fair (+2) Shoot or Good (+3) Engineering.

#### Ship Skills Modify Character Skills

Ship and character skills interact, such that a character with the appropriate character skill receives a modifier based on the ship skill, getting a +1 bonus if the ship’s skill is greater than hers, and a -1 penalty if the ship’s is less than hers. Ties have no effect.

> The interstellar bounty hunter Xandra Hellas has Great (+4) Shoot but is aboard the _Pleasant Idyll_, an aristocrat’s yacht with Average (+1) Laser Cannons. She may fire the ship’s weapons as a Good (+3) attack. In other words, since the ship’s skill is lower than the gunner’s it reduces the gunner’s rating by one. If the ship’s skill had been higher than the gunner’s, the attack would have been Superb (+5).

#### Character Skills Modify Ship Skills

As above, except the base skill is the ship’s and the modifier is the character’s. Ties have no effect.

> In this case, Xandra could fire the _Pleasant Idyll’s_ weapons as a Fair (+2) attack. In other words, since the gunner’s skill is higher than the ship’s, it increases the ship’s rating by one. If the gunner’s skill had been lower than the ship’s, the attack would have been Mediocre (+0).

#### Character Skills Determine Success, Ship Skills Determine Effect

A character with the appropriate skill takes action, but upon success the effectiveness of that action is determined by rolling with the relevant ship skill. If the character succeeds with style, add a +2 bonus to the roll for effect.

> The _Pleasant Idyll_ is being attacked by pirates intent on boarding. As the pirate ship closes in, Xandra fires the yacht’s weapons using Shoot against the pirate helmswoman’s Pilot. If successful, the _Pleasant Idyll’s_ Average (+1) Laser Cannons must then pierce the pirate ship’s Fair (+2) Shields.

This method increases the time it takes to resolve an action, and so should be considered carefully before being implemented. Some groups will regard this method as a step backward from Fate’s usual, more streamlined way of doing things, but it does highlight the tension or gap between the skill of an individual and the quality of their tools.

### As Approaches

If spacecraft are differentiated by _how_ they do things, rather than _what_ they do, then you may want to give them approaches, as in _Fate Accelerated_, rather than skills.

> A **Galactic Dreadnought** has approaches of Fair (+2) Careful, Mediocre (+0) Clever, Average (+1) Flashy, Good (+3) Forceful, Mediocre (+0) Quick, and Poor (-1) Sneaky, while an **Imperial Courier Ship** has Mediocre (+0) Careful, Average (+1) Clever, Mediocre (+0) Flashy, Poor (-1) Forceful, Good (+3) Quick, and Fair (+2) Sneaky.

Using approaches also differentiates the scales of the ship and characters. Character skills would get used at a small, personal scale, while ship approaches would get used at a large, space scale.

You might even describe the capabilities of ships in the setting by renaming the ship approaches, such as Aggressive, Fast, Nimble, Robust, Roomy, and Versatile.

### As Stunts with Refresh

Spacecraft may be given one to three free stunts, which characters aboard can access as extras, given appropriate permission, as well as a refresh rating that may be spent to purchase more stunts.

> The characters are set aboard a space cruiser patrolling the edge of known space. The game uses a star map of systems in the cruiser’s patrol area, and the GM creates a new system map for each star system the cruiser enters, comprising planetary surface zones, orbital zones around each planet, and deep space zones reflecting the distance between planets.

> The space cruiser has three free stunts and a refresh of 3\. Characters on the ship can use their skills to plot its course (Astrogation), operate its controls (Pilot), fire its weapons (Gunnery), operate its sensors and communicators (Science), and maintain its systems (Engineering). The players decide to give it the stunt Point Defense Lasers (use Gunnery in place of Pilot to defend against missiles, torpedoes, or boarding craft in the same zone) and Sensor Pod (+2 to Science when using the ship’s instruments to create an advantage on the target of a sensor scan).

> The ship’s subordinate spacecraft are also represented as stunts. For example, the Space Fighter stunt allows a character to use Pilot to move away from the ship on the system map (as if using Athletics on a surface map) and attack targets in the same zone, but the character can’t land on or take off from planetary surfaces. In contrast, the Landing Craft stunt allows a character to move through space, land on a planet, and take off again using Pilot, but it grants no attack capability.

> With four stunts, the space cruiser reduces its refresh to 2\. Any fate points in the ship’s pool can be spent by the ship’s captain to aid any crew member’s action.

### As a Deckplan

The spaceship can have a blueprint, showing the zones through which characters move in order to access the ship’s capabilities, which may be defined as aspects, skills, approaches, stunts, or some combination.

# Space Combat

This section provides a number of options for handling play when the shooting starts. To begin, we will look at a standard approach to space combat.

If all the PCs are crew and passengers aboard the same ship, space combat needn’t be too different from any other Fate conflict. The presence of an enemy ship, squadron, or flotilla can add urgency to PC efforts to complete their own repairs, conclude negotiations, or perform some other vital task. Ideally, while some crew members are taking action to deal with enemy forces, others will be performing other important actions—even if only trying to hold it together in the face of the prospect of imminent death by vacuum exposure (that is, defending with Will to avoid taking mental stress).

> The crew of the freelance exploration vessel _Ganymede with a Laser Beam_ is returning from a rescue mission in deep space, headed for the wormhole station that connects to Earth, in orbit around planet Terranova. The crew consists of three characters: the ship’s pilot, its gunner, and its engineer.

> The GM draws a zone map with Terranova, its orbital space and the portal within it, a zone of space near the planet, and a deep space zone. She places a marker for the _Ganymede_ in the deep space zone.

> The GM tells the players that they have detected a burst of gravity waves from the direction of Terranova, consistent with wormhole egress, and she places a marker for the bogey in the Terranova orbit zone. She knows that this is a mercenary corvette hired by a foreign government that wants the scientist’s secrets for itself, crewed by a steely nerved captain, a jaunty pilot, a pair of crack gunners, and a team of space marines.

> The corvette is equipped with high-speed atomic missiles that can attack targets in the same or an adjacent zone with Gunnery versus Pilot, and gets +2 to attack targets in the same zone. It also has close-range plasma guns for point defense—they can only attack targets that have an aspect indicating their very close range to the corvette—that attack with Gunnery versus Engineering, reflecting that the target is defending with its structural resilience. The _Ganymede_, in contrast, only has a repurposed mining laser, capable of attacking targets in the same zone, using Gunnery versus Pilot.

> The _Ganymede_ is trying to make its way toward the portal and return to Earth with their rescued scientist, who apparently knows the location of an alien wormhole station! The bogey’s intentions are unknown. The GM tells the players to roll Spacehand to determine turn order.

> The crew of the _Ganymede_ decides to zoom straight for the portal. The GM tells the pilot that she needs a Great (+4) result with Pilot to cross the zones between deep space and the portal, and then another Great (+4) result to avoid plowing into the portal at high speed while decelerating for portal insertion, which will require a Fair (+2) result with Pilot. At that point, they will have escaped. During their turns, the other PCs aboard the ship could take action to scan, target, or analyze the corvette; shoot at the enemy; or do whatever else seems appropriate. However, the crew of the corvette will try to intercept the _Ganymede_, its gunners firing their missiles as the pilot pours on the speed to close to plasma-gun range. The captain has orders to disable the PCs’ ship, send the space marines to board it, and capture the scientist. Each ship has zero or more stress boxes and a set of consequences. When a ship is taken out, the opponent gets to say what happens to it.

## Step 1: Set the Scene

Sketch out a zone map representing the volume of space in which the conflict is taking place. Typically, this will be a map of empty space with planets and moons as well as important artificial constructs—space stations and stargates, for example—arranged into zones to reflect their relative distances. Add aspects to zones, as needed.

*   At high plausibility, most zones will be deep space, but some will represent **gravity wells**—planets and other astronomical objects with enough mass to affect the performance of ships. Such objects can also be sources of intense radiation or magnetism hazardous to spacecraft or their crew. Gravity wells permit spacecraft to make slingshot or gravity-assist maneuvers to accelerate, decelerate, or change course, and they allow craft with high-thrust rockets to accelerate more efficiently via the Oberth effect by firing their rockets while diving into a gravity well. Planets with atmosphere allow for deceleration by aerobraking.
*   At medium plausibility, add nebula and clouds of space dust that obscure visibility, solar flares that pose radiation hazards, and rogue neutron stars and black holes to interfere with maneuvering, for example.
*   At low plausibility, you can add jam-packed asteroid belts, psychic nebula, deep space astro-monsters, and intense but free-floating radiation clouds, to make things interesting.

Then, note the ranges at which sensors will reliably detect vessels and objects on the map. Typically, everything on the map will be basically visible to others, although ships may try to minimize their energy radiation (with Engineering) or blend in with a **Cluttered Sensor Background** (using Pilot) in order to evade an opponent’s attention. By the same token, “brighter” objects—those radiating more energy—are easier to detect than darker ones. All else being equal, objects in a distant zone may be harder to detect and identify than those in adjacent zones, which are in turn more difficult than those in the same zone, depending on the acuity of a ship’s sensor equipment.

## Step 2: Determine Turn Order

You can determine turn order with Notice or a skill more related to space such as Science, Astrogation, or Pilot. Alternately, you can use Command to reflect the efficiency of a well-run ship, or if the ship itself has skills, you can use its Sensors or Scanners.

## Step 3: Establish Movement Rules

The movement rules you choose will help establish the feel of space combat in your setting. We’ve included a few options here.

### Standard Movement

In _Fate Core_, participants in a conflict can move one zone per exchange for free, and can move multiple zones by taking an overcome action using an appropriate skill. At low or medium plausibility, this could be Pilot (“Pedal to the metal, commander!”), Engineering (“Get us out of here, Scotty!”), or Astrogation (“Align to escape vector!”). If the ship has skills, its Drive or Thrust may be appropriate.

Set the effect level for movement however seems appropriate. For example, the ship may be able to move one extra zone with a Mediocre (+0) result, with another extra zone for every two shifts above that—i.e., two zones at Fair (+2), three zones at Great (+4), and four zones at Fantastic (+6).

Other special or complicated maneuvers like entering orbit around a planet or docking with a space station may also require the pilot to spend the exchange taking an overcome action. A ship in such a maneuver can’t take evasive action against enemy fire, and so defends with Mediocre (+0) Pilot.

### Burn Movement

In burn movement, zones represent relatively stable “orbits” which ships occupy. In other words, occupying a zone means that the ship is moving along a particular path or course that, because of inertia, requires no further expenditure of energy. This could be an orbit around a planet or other celestial body, or a **transfer orbit** that will eventually intersect with the trajectory of another ship, planet, or satellite. Such an orbit can be represented with an aspect reflecting the time required for the spacecraft to reach its destination on its current trajectory.

> The deep-space freighter _Alfresco_ is in a zone representing interplanetary space in the Solar System. Because of its crew’s previous actions, it has the aspect **Six Months to Mars!** Without further action by the crew, after six months the _Alfresco_ will reach Mars and can be placed in a Mars orbit zone.

Moving from one zone to another implies that a ship is using energy to change its orbit. To move their ship at all, a crew must expend delta-vee via a **burn**, a Pilot roll that uses some of its available thrust to change its orbit. On a success, the ship moves to an adjacent zone. Failure means the ship may be **Off Course** or **Going Too Fast**, suffer damage or equipment failure, or get itself in some other danger. A ship with limited delta-vee may be given some **fuel stress** or other currency to spend on a minor cost, or the ship may be given **Fuel Reserves Low** or **Bingo Fuel** as a major cost.

> The fusion-powered torch ship _Hermes Zephyr_ is in orbit around Earth when it gets orders to intercept the _Alfresco_, already in deep space headed for Mars, two months into its six-month journey. This is well within the capabilities of the _Hermes Zephyr_, with its massive delta-vee.

> Noting that a high-thrust, high-specific-impulse spacecraft can cover interplanetary distances in several weeks (see the Travel Time table), and that the _Alfresco_ is taking several months to cover the same approximate distance, the GM sets an Average (+1) difficulty to break out of Earth’s orbit and head into deep space after the slow boat to Mars.

> On a success, the _Hermes Zephyr_ moves from Earth orbit into deep space and will rendezvous with the _Alfresco_ after several weeks. On a success with style, the time is only a few weeks. A minor cost might mean the ship takes longer or must make another, more difficult burn to match velocities with the _Alfresco_. A major cost might be damage to the ship’s drives or an expenditure of its fuel reserves.

The stronger the gravity well in which the ship’s orbit is located, the more difficult the burn, but some stunts or aspects of the ship (**Booster Stage**) or crew (**Aerobraking Expert**) can make some maneuvers easier.

If ships have skills, the ship’s Thrust or Drive can be opposed by its own Mass or Hull rating, and situation aspects such as gravity can be invoked as appropriate.

Other special maneuvers require overcome actions, as in standard movement.

### Mixed Movement

In mixed movement, some ships use burn movement while others use standard movement depending on their ship’s technology. For example, ships with high thrust would use standard movement while ships with low thrust would use burn movement. Ships with high specific impulse would not generally become **Out of Fuel**, while those with low specific impulse most definitely would.

## Step 4: Note Weapon Ranges and Attack and Defense Skills

These rules depend much on the sorts of technology present in the setting. Weapons may have a maximum range in zones, or may face greater difficulty when attacking more distant targets. You can also differentiate weapons by how they are used. For example, a hunter drone may attack with Pilot, while a laser cannon might attack with Gunnery. Similarly, the target of the hunter drone may defend with Pilot, while the target of the laser cannon may use Engineering to reflect the ship’s countermeasures and its resilience to damage.

Ships may have stunts representing improved technical capabilities, and characters may have stunts reflecting their skills and experience. Additionally, technological differences between ships from different cultures may be reflected in reduced difficulties for ships from the more technically advanced civilization.

In space combat, the costs of failure may include the following:

*   Physical stress or consequences for the crew, representing injuries suffered on the job.
*   Mental stress or consequences for the crew, representing loss of nerve or morale.
*   Physical stress or consequences for the ship or its components, representing damage or equipment failure.
*   Adverse situation aspects representing strain on resources and equipment, such as **Low Fuel** or **Overheated Power Plant**, or representing reflecting tactical disadvantages, such as **Patterns in Evasion Course** or **Showing Up Bright on Enemy Scopes**.

## Vector Diagrams

If zone maps don’t give you the feeling of satisfying space combat, you may want to sketch out **vector diagrams**. This approach is more complicated than standard movement—you will have to be aware of the various ranges between opposing ships as well as their relative speeds and bearings—but it can be a satisfying alternative.

A vector diagram represents each ship as a vector—an arrow whose length reflects the ship’s speed, pointed in the direction of the ship’s heading, positioned according to the ranges between the ship and the others.

Over the course of one or more exchanges, the ships will be moved along the length of their vectors; every so often, the GM or a player may extend, shorten, or redraw vectors to reflect changes caused by space maneuvers.

During play, the GM can set difficulties for tasks like tracking an enemy ship with the ship’s lasers, computing a firing solution for the ship’s missiles, or matching course with a bogie by identifying salient factors such as range, relative velocity, and perhaps bearing. Typically, firing at or maneuvering against a ship on a parallel course moving at the same velocity without acceleration faces Average (+1) difficulty; things get harder from there.

### Range

*   Contact: The target ship’s hull is in contact with yours. Most ship’s weapons will not bear on another ship in contact, particularly if the target is much smaller.
*   Proximity: The target ship is sufficiently close to permit physical exchange via spacewalk or similar means. Point-defense weapons (e.g., guns) can be used. Ship’s ordnance (missiles and torpedoes) will not have a chance to arm, but drones may be launched normally.
*   Close: The target ship is within visual range, and normal beam weapons are in optimal range. High-powered spinal mounts (i.e., large beam weapons mounted coaxially along the ship’s length) may not be able to bear on the target. Firing solutions for missiles and torpedoes are easily found.
*   Medium: Sensors can easily distinguish features of the target ship. Torpedoes and missiles may fire.
*   Long: Sensors can distinguish most of the important features of a target ship. Normal beam weapons are at a disadvantage due to attenuation. Firing solutions for missiles may be found, but slow-moving torpedoes will have a more difficult time hitting their targets.
*   Very Long: Sensors can only identify the most prominent features of the target ship.
*   Extreme: The target ship can be detected only as a point source, and is out of range of the ship’s weapons.

### Velocity and Relative Speed

*   Accelerating: The target ship is increasing its speed.
*   Coasting: The target ship is neither gaining nor losing speed.
*   Decelerating: The target ship is reducing its speed.
*   Faster: The target is moving more rapidly than your ship.
*   Matched: The target is moving at the same speed as your ship.
*   Slower: The target is moving more slowly than your ship.

If you’re dealing with multiple ships, you can assign absolute velocities using the ladder, so a high-speed interceptor may be moving at Fantastic (+6) speed, while a bulk transport on a low-fuel transfer orbit may only be moving at Mediocre (+0) speed. Ships with high thrust can change speed faster than ships with low thrust; ships with high specific impulse can accelerate and decelerate over longer periods of time than ships with low specific impulse.

### Bearing

*   Converging Course: The target’s vector will converge on your ship’s course.
*   Intercept Course: A converging course in which the two ships will come within range of each other at matching velocities and parallel courses.
*   Collision Course: A converging course in which the two ships will come into proximity or make contact without matching velocities.
*   Overtaking: The target’s vector will come upon your ship’s course from the stern.
*   Oncoming: The target’s vector will come toward your ship’s course from the bow.
*   Parallel Course: The target’s vector will maintain its distance from your ship’s course.
*   Diverging Course: The target’s vector will diverge from your ship’s course.
*   Escape Course: The target is ahead of your ship along the same vector and moving away.

### Apparent Size

More massive or radiant targets will be easier to detect and target than low-mass or low-energy targets. Warships in particular will be prepared to rig for silent running, with drives powered down and energy usage minimized so as to be less noticeable to opponents. Conversely, drones fitted with transmitters at different frequencies may be used as decoys, fooling opponents outside of visual range.

## Range Zones

With many ships in space combat, a useful, simple compromise between zones and vector diagrams is range zones. First, create a zone map consisting of eight to ten bands of space, and place markers representing ships and other space objects in them. At the beginning of each exchange, a pilot in each formation rolls Pilot. Beginning with the lowest roll, each pilot chooses to have their ship stand still, to move one zone in either direction, or to move a single other ship that has not yet moved. If you are using phased combat, this takes place in the piloting phase, replacing the Maneuver option.

At the end of this process, ships in the same zone are in visual range and capable of using extremely short-range weapons, like tractor beams or point-defense guns. Ships one or two zones away can fire beam weapons at each other, and ships three or four zones away can fire missiles or torpedoes at each other. A ship that is seven or more zones away from any other ship, or which moves off the edge of the map, has broken off combat.

Resolve beam attacks and other short-range weapons immediately. Resolve missile attacks immediately if the target is within two zones, at the start of the next exchange if within four, and at the start of the second next exchange if within six. Torpedoes are placed on the map as if they were ships, and they move using the gunner’s Shoot skill on their roll. Resolve a torpedo attack when it enters the same zone as its target.

In some settings, the acuity of ship sensors will affect its ability to acquire targets beyond a certain range. A reasonable rule of thumb is to use twice the ship’s Sensors rating as its range in zones, so Average (+1) Sensors detect reliably out two zones, Fair (+2) Sensors out to four, Good (+3) out to six, and so forth. Scale modifiers (see below) may affect detection range, and attempts at stealth or misdirection can be resolved as opposed rolls (e.g., Pilot versus Notice). Otherwise, just assume that the maximum detection range equals the maximum engagement range (six bands).

## Phased Space Combat

If you need to further regulate space combat, you can break up each exchange into ordered phases, with each character taking a specific action during the appropriate phase. Characters may act in multiple phases, but a character who takes multiple actions during an exchange rolls for subsequent actions against +1 difficulty per previous action taken.

These rules make some assumptions about the nature of space weaponry, though you may wish to change these assumptions to reflect the armaments of your setting. Additionally, ships and characters may have stunts that affect their performance, as always.

If there is any question about who acts first within a phase, the character with the highest relevant skill has initiative and decides whether to go first or wait to see what happens when someone else acts.

### Phase 1: Piloting Phase

During this phase, pilots control their ships and drone operators may pilot their drones.

#### Evade

A pilot may defend with Pilot against incoming attacks. A ship that doesn’t evade will have Mediocre (+0) defense against attacks, modified as necessary by range and speed, until the next piloting phase. Use the pilot’s **evade** **result** as the ship’s defense against beam and missile attacks as well as opposing maneuvers.

#### Maneuver

A pilot may use Pilot versus a defending pilot to change its range and bearing to the target, creating advantages or overcoming disadvantages as appropriate. A ship that doesn’t evade will have Mediocre (+0) defense against opposing maneuvers, modified as necessary by range and speed, until the next piloting phase.

#### Ordnance Movement

Missiles, torpedoes, and drones that have been launched move toward their targets. Ordnance that reaches its target during this phase detonates; the target defends with its pilot’s evade result.

*   Missiles are fast-moving, self-guided, single-use munitions.
*   Torpedoes are slow-moving, self-guided, single-use munitions.
*   Drones are remote-operated small craft that may be armed with short-range point-defense weaponry, equipped with an explosive payload to self-destruct, or maneuvered toward a target to relay close-range sensor data to the controlling ship. They are recoverable if not detonated or destroyed.

### Phase 2: Gunnery Phase

Crew at weapons controls may take the following actions against detected targets.

#### Weapons Fire

Crew at beam weapons and gun controls may attack any detected targets in range, rolling Shoot (Gunnery) against the target’s evade result for this exchange. Beam and gun attacks are resolved immediately.

#### Ordnance Launch

Crew at ordnance controls may launch missiles, torpedoes, and drones. This is usually a Shoot (Gunnery), Lore (Science or Astrogation), or Drive (Pilot) roll against Mediocre (+0) difficulty. Resolve the attack when the ordnance arrives at the target during ordnance movement in the piloting phase.

### Phase 3: Encounter and Detection Phase

#### Scanning

Crew at scanning controls may use Lore (Science), Notice, or Investigate to examine the ship’s sensor readings and interpret the data they provide, as well as to analyze the behavior of detected threats and to identify potential patterns or weaknesses. The difficulty of these overcome and create advantage actions can be set by the GM, depending on the nature of the potential threat, with larger, closer, and more radiant targets easier to spot and analyze than smaller, farther, and less radiant targets. Failure to detect opponents may create advantageous circumstances for the opposition, letting them act with relative impunity during the next exchange.

Crew with access to electronic countermeasures may use Lore (Science) or Crafts (Engineering) to spoof or jam a target’s sensors, creating advantages.

Crew at weapons controls may use Shoot to create advantages related to aiming or detecting patterns in enemy flight paths.

*   Ships are either in range or out of range of each other’s weapons, and one overcome action versus an opposing Pilot roll is sufficient to break off an encounter.
*   Ships may be at boarding range (which presumes matched velocities), beam range, missile range, or out of range. Under near-future conditions, boarding range is only possible when a target is incapable of maneuvering or willing to match velocities.
*   Ships may use range zones to determine which weapons may be used.

### Phase 4: Damage Control and Other Actions

#### Damage Control

Use Engineering to deal with problems caused by accumulated waste heat, mechanical and electronics failures, and related issues.

#### Medical Treatment

Use Science to treat injuries to personnel.

#### Other Actions

Resolve anything else a character attempts to accomplish during a space battle that isn’t covered by other actions.

## Differences of Scale

Sometimes the difference in scale between two ships (or any two actors in a scene) is so great that common sense suggests they are just incompatible and cannot affect one another. At any time, the GM can indicate such incompatibility of scale: if players want to use a mosquito to take down an elephant, that needs to be the focus of the session or the campaign, not a single roll.

Two things may affect each other normally, or their relationship may be governed by a situation aspect (**That’s No Moon**) or scale rule that means, for example, that the snub fighter can’t target the dreadnaught as a whole, but it can attack its fighter bay or its laser turrets one by one as they return fire. Alternately, PCs can work to find ways to change this relationship: stolen plans from a moon-sized battlestation might reveal a vulnerable exhaust port...

The _Fate System Toolkit_ (page 67) has useful rules for resolving differences in scale. In summary, give each ship a **size rating** on a scale from smallest to largest. For each step of difference in size, the larger ship gets +1 to its attack or defense or both, and gains a Weapon rating of 2, Armor rating of 2, or both. To reflect a smaller ship’s greater maneuverability compared with the larger, you may give it +1 per step of size difference to create advantage or overcome actions related to maneuvering against the larger ship.

Alternately, you can use the Bronze Rule from _Fate Core_ (page 270) to send whole squadrons of fighters against capital ships, with the controlling player representing the squadron’s leader or the ship’s captain, whose fate is tied to that of their comrades. GMs, you can offer a compel to have the PC put his or her commanding character’s life on the line, or a character may have a stunt that allows them to take damage in place of their ship or squadron, reflecting the perils of leading the charge.

## Battlestations

Another way to approach combat is not to focus on the ship, but on the characters each acting within the much larger conflict. In this option, each ship has a number of **stations**, each of which is a functional role occupied by a character, enabling that character to use particular ship-related skills to perform some action. It is treated as an extra with no cost requiring assignment to an existing station aboard the ship on which a character is serving.

Using battlestations is particularly helpful when the PCs are serving aboard a huge spaceship that might not be threatened as an entirety, but the GM wants to maintain some level of personal threat. It also works when PCs are on multiple small ships, such as a fighter squadron, with each operating on a local scale but contributing to a larger effort.

Mechanically, a station is an extra that allow for various specific actions, and which has one or more aspects relevant to it, one or more stunts, and some amount of **battle stress**, reflecting the damage the ship can withstand before the station can’t be used by anyone anymore until it’s fixed.

At the beginning of an exchange, a character can change stations freely within the bounds of the fiction, although the GM may require an overcome action to represent the time and effort needed to make the switch—for example, an Athletics or Spacehand action to race to the bridge to take over as captain, for example, or a Spacehand or Rank action to get into the ship’s armory to acquire space marine weaponry and armor. The precise skill and its difficulty will depend on the fiction and the character’s course of action.

Each ship or squadron in the fight gets one set of consequences. The ship or squadron remains in the fight so long as it hasn’t suffered a complete set of consequences. It also gets a number of stations, each of which serves as a target for the enemy as well as enabling a particular function such as maneuvering the ship, firing its weapons, and so forth.

Stations suffer harm from attacks and from the station’s occupant succeeding at a cost, both as normal. The station’s occupant can also suffer harm by succeeding at a cost, but since the point of using battlestations is to make space combat fast and fun, the occupant cannot take harm meant for the battlestation.

When it suffers harm, the station must take battle stress or permit the ship as a whole to suffer consequences. If the station loses all its battle stress, both it and its occupant are taken out. Alternately, instead of letting their station take battle stress or allowing the ship to suffer consequences, the player may concede and either allow their character to be taken out—this preserves the station and permits another character to take it up if desired—or abandon the station, allowing the station to be taken out but preserving the character.

When a station is taken out, it cannot be used further. A character who has abandoned a station may take up a different station—if one is available—the next time they can act freely. The GM may require the character to overcome dangers suggested by the station being taken out—explosive decompression is always a possibility! A character without a station may be **In the Way** or at best **Supercargo**. A redundant character of this sort can take personal actions but can’t substantively affect the space battle.

Change the skills listed for each station as appropriate to the setting.

## Example of Space Combat

This example of combat is set in the _Pax Galactica_ universe and uses battlestations and vector diagrams. The group has set the plausibilometer to medium.

As the scene begins, three PCs are trying to figure out the workings of a derelict starship they’ve found in an uninhabited system in the galaxy’s Norma Arm, a region of space that was long ago the site of a centuries-long war for dominance between two alien empires. The ambitious and possibly piratical NPC who helped them find it, Lord Captain Mufese, has offered to “escort” them back to civilization, but they have demurred, and Mufese aboard his ship the _Orinocco_ is seemingly departing in good grace. The PCs turn their attention back to the alien starship, whose name they have translated to mean _Homecoming_.

*   Brad is playing Lark, a **Grizzled Old Space** **Hand**.
*   Chris is playing Sergeant Childe, the **Hard-Bitten Vet of a Hundred Little** **Wars**.
*   Amy is playing Lady Tabitha, an **Adventurous Aristocrat from the Oute****r Rim**.

GM: The _Orinocco_ spirals out in its orbit and soon disappears behind the gas giant. Lord Captain Mufese broadcasts general farewell and wishes you good luck.

Brad (Lark): Okay. In the meantime, I want to break down our capabilities. I’m going to check out the hyperdrive. The ship has an engineering section?

GM: That’s right. You’re in the ship’s engine room, in the narrow confines toward the rear of the teardrop-shaped hull. Use Technoscience to overcome an obstacle. Call it Mediocre (+0), but it’s alien technology, not from the Principate, which means you face a +2 increase to the difficulty to try to understand it.

Brad: My Technoscience is Good (+3), and the roll is... (Rolls <span>++--.) That’s a +3.</span>

GM: That beats the modified difficulty of Fair (+2), so it’s still a success.

Brad: I’m out of fate points. What does a basic success get me?

GM: No, that’s plenty. You see a hyperdrive—sealed in a clear spherical vacuum case like the ones you’re familiar with—but its navigation coupling doesn’t lead to the normal psionic circuitry you’d expect. Instead it connects to another sealed sphere with an object inside that looks like a branching coral made of translucent crystal. There’s a dim glow coming from inside the crystal. Childe, what are you doing?

Chris (Sergeant Childe): Sergeant Childe is checking out the bridge.

GM: Good. There are four three-dimensional screens arranged in kind of a circle around the perimeter of the bridge. Currently only one of them is on, and it shows a holographic representation of the satellite system around the gas giant. There are no chairs, but there do appear to be four sets of clips on flexible cords latched to the floor in front of each station.

Brad: Does this ship not have inertial dampers? We have artificial gravity, after all.

GM: The aliens were probably worried about acceleration bleed through the dampers, you think.

Brad: Uh, yeah, okay. I would probably think that.

Chris: Do our suits have harnesses that would fit those clips?

GM: They do. Are you in your suit?

Chris: Yes?

Amy (Lady Tabitha): We’re all in our suits, ready to seal if something happens.

GM: Well, that’s good, because something happens. A klaxon sounds, a high whistle chirping between two notes. Tell me what each of you is doing.

Amy: I’m on the bridge, getting a feel for the thruster controls.

GM: Here’s your Helm battlestation. (The GM gives Amy a card with the Helm’s battlestation details on it.)

Brad: I’m in the engine room, trying to get full power going. (Brad gets the Engineer battlestation card.)

Chris: The sergeant is on the bridge. He’s checking out the sensor display. (The GM gives Chris the Scanner battlestation, and puts three other station cards on the table—the Captain, Gun Crew, and Helm)

GM: Okay, the holodisplay shows you in your orbit around the gas giant, but there’s a fast-moving object coming toward you rapidly from over the horizon. (The GM sketches out the situation, with the _Homecoming_ in orbit around a gas giant with a radiation belt around it and a rocky moon some distance away as well as an incoming bogey.)

Brad: How long until we can activate the hyperdrive? I want to get out of here.

GM: Roll Technoscience. Remember that you’re still trying to figure out how things work on an alien ship. If you succeed with style, you can fire it up immediately. If you succeed, it’ll take a few minutes. Succeeding at a cost or failing means it’ll take longer, one shift more time for each shift short of a success you get.

Brad: What’s the difficulty? Zero?

GM: Right, so call it Fair (+2) due to the penalty for alien technology.

Brad: I’m peering at the alien controls in the engine room, tentatively pressing buttons and turning dials. (Rolls <span>+--0.) I’m at zero—success at a minor cost. That just means a little more time, right? Several minutes? (See “How Much Time Is a Shi<span>ft Worth?” in _Fate Core_ on page 197.)</span></span>

GM: Sure, but you know that you’re **Getting Too Old for this Sh****, right? (The GM holds up a fate point to indicate that he is compelling the character’s aspect.)

Brad: Damn straight. (He takes the fate point.)

GM: It’s going to take you a solid hour to warm up the hyperdrive, at the rate things are going.

Amy: I don’t know why you’re worrying about the hyperdrive. Without a psionic link, how am I going to navigate us anywhere? Sergeant Childe, what’s that thing coming toward us?

Chris: I don’t know. Can I identify it?

GM: Roll Technoscience to do so.

Chris: Okay. I’m Average (+1). (He rolls <span>0+-0.) And that’s an Average (+1) result. But I’m **Cool Under Pressure**, so I succeed. (He spends a fate point. The GM labels the bogey _Orinocco_.)</span>

GM: He’s coming up fast, on an intercept course.

Amy: Mufese! You scalawag! What are you up to?

GM: Are you broadcasting to him?

Amy: No, I won’t give him the satisfaction. I’m going to break out of orbit and head for that moon. What do I use? Spacehand? (The GM says yes.) Okay. I’m Good (+3) at that. I roll... (Rolls <span>+++0.) Yes! A Fantastic (+6) effort!</span>

GM: Mufese’s roll to pursue is Great (+4), but you’re using alien technology, so his roll gets a +2 relative to yours, making it a tie; you succeed at a minor cost. You punch the thrusters and tear out of orbit, but you all feel the acceleration bleed as a kind of vibration in your bodies, and you can tell that the ship’s **Systems Are All a Little Scrambled** as a minor consequence. (The GM redraws the _Homecoming_’s vector as a long arrow pointing halfway toward the rocky moon.)

Chris: Is this ship armed?

GM: Maybe. While you’re looking for weapons controls, the communicator chimes. Incoming message.

Brad: Is the klaxon still blaring? That would be annoying.

GM: I’m glad you mentioned that. (He writes down **Annoying Klaxon** on a card as a situation aspect.)

Amy: Don’t answer the comms! Let him eat static!

GM: Childe, you see the _Orinocco_ launch a missile at your ship!

Chris: Boss lady, we’re in trouble!

Amy: Evasive action! (Rolls <span>-0--.) Oh no! That’s Terrible (-2)! But I’m **At the Helm** with a cool eye and steady hand. (She spends a fate point.)</span>

GM: Yes, but that **Annoying Klaxon** is getting on your nerves. (He spends a fate point from his pool.)

Amy: Somebody shut off that gosh-darn klaxon!

GM: The missile gets in a Fair (+2) strike on the thrusters from Mufese’s Good (+3) Shoot and a Poor (-1) roll. He’s targeting Helm. But your **Systems Are All a Little Scrambled**, so the ultimate effect is a Great (+4) hit on the ship. Amy, what happens?

Amy: Oh, man. Marking a stress box won’t quite do it, and I don’t want to lose another ship’s consequence. I’ll abandon the station.

GM: What does that look like?

Amy: The whole bridge shudders with the missile impact. The screen in front of me goes haywire, lots of alien sigils forming and melting. The thruster controls lock up. I pull on them uselessly and shout, “He got us! We’re a sitting duck unless you get those thrusters back online, Lark!”

Brad: I’m on it, boss lady!

GM: All right, that’s the exchange. The Helm station is out of action, so where is everyone?

Amy: I’ll take the captain’s chair. Uh, harness.

Brad: I’m good in the engine room.

Chris: And I’ll switch to guns. This thing does have weapons, right?

_The action continues..._

# Aliens and Alien Worlds

More so than in most any other Fate campaign, Fate Space games tend to emphasize travel and exploration. Even though it’s tempting and can be fun, you won’t have enough time to plan out a whole galaxy or even a whole solar system before beginning a game! Therefore, GMs, we encourage you to paint in broad strokes to begin while having procedures ready for determining what characters find as they travel during play.

This list of questions will help you pin down the role that aliens and alien worlds will play in your game.

Are there intelligent aliens?

*   No. Humans are alone in the universe, at least as far as we know. However, there are distant worlds to explore, and intelligent life may yet be discovered on one of them.
*   No, but humanity has diverged into so many different subtypes and variants that there might as well be.
*   No, but scientists have used genetic engineering or similar technologies to enhance the intelligence and communication skills of animal species, uplifting dogs, bears, dolphins and/or monkeys.
*   Maybe, but we haven’t met any yet. This game involves discovering new alien life forms and societies. Nonintelligent extraterrestrial life may indeed be common.
*   Yes, but they have all died out or been destroyed. This game involves finding their relics and figuring out who they were.
*   Yes, a few. Humanity has encountered a handful of distinct alien species and has a history and interspecies relationship with each. There may or may not be any more out there to meet.
*   Yes, many! Space is teeming with alien species. We have met a good number of them, and have learned of many more.
*   In fact, _we_ are the aliens—humanity no longer exists, or is not the focus of this game.

If there are aliens, where do they live or where can they be found?

*   They have their own worlds, and it is unusual to find a species away from their homeworld. If we want to meet aliens, we have to go visit them.
*   They may come from somewhere else or have previously traveled widely, but now they live in specific quarters or districts on one or more worlds we inhabit.
*   They travel more or less freely among us, coming from a homeworld where they may be found in greater numbers.
*   We don’t know where they come from, only that they show up near our territory or on our worlds.
*   They have conquered our planet, and we resist with some measure of effectiveness.
*   Different aliens have different modes of living that bring them into contact with us in different ways.

If there are multiple inhabited worlds, what is the political relationship among them?

*   Each world is a distinct and sovereign political entity...
    *   ...with very little ability or desire to influence other planets.
    *   ...with its own recognized sphere of influence, zone of control, or other territory, negotiated on a bilateral basis with neighboring worlds.
    *   ...competing in a general struggle for control of unclaimed territories or other resources.
    *   ...interested in shoring up its alliances and maintaining a balance of power against equally self-interested rivals.

Some worlds are colonies or settlements of more-important worlds, or are otherwise dependent upon those worlds. Some sort of core/frontier settlement pattern may exist.

Each world is subordinate to some larger interplanetary or interstellar authority, hegemony, or imperium, which exerts overarching political, economic, and/or social control.

What is the economic relationship among inhabited worlds?

*   Each world is basically independent. Any trade between worlds involves luxuries or novelties rather than essential commodities. Small freighters and smugglers ply the spacelanes.
*   Some worlds are colonies, clients, or outposts of another world upon which they are highly dependent, although the mother planet or homeworld is relatively self-sufficient. The central planet sends out freighters filled with workers, supplies, and equipment, and return laden with raw materials and exotic commodities.
*   Worlds are highly interdependent, specializing in producing goods or offering services in which they have some competitive advantage, and importing other necessities. This is the most fragile economic system, where the blockade or failure of one world is felt throughout the rest of that region of space. Bulk freighters work the main trade routes while smaller merchant ships subsist on the margins.

What are the social and cultural relationships among worlds?

*   Each world is a distinct society comprising a number of subcultures and social groupings, and is alien to other worlds.
*   Each world is a distinct and relatively homogeneous monoculture, recognizably different from those of other worlds and alien to them.
*   Worlds are part of a larger interstellar or interplanetary society, sharing many common institutions and traditions but each possessing distinct cultural characteristics.
*   Worlds are part of a larger interstellar or interplanetary society, with each world populated by a mix of subcultures that are common across the larger society.

## Planetary Ecosystems

When you need to create an alien world, you can use these tables. The World Types table provides a variety of high- to medium-plausibility planet types, not all of which are inherently habitable to human beings or even carbon-based lifeforms. The Habitable Worlds table, as a whole, is low to medium plausibility.

Ammonia World: An outer-zone ecosystem that uses a corrosive ammonia-water solution instead of just water as its basic solvent, with dissolved ammonia-water ice acting as antifreeze. Intelligent life on such a world would have a hard time creating a technological civilization.

Artificial Habitat: The “world” is a technological construct, ranging in size from a small station to an artificial world to a star-girdling Dyson sphere or swarm.

Brimstone World: A sulfur-rich planet with sulfur dioxide seas, sulfur shores, and an atmosphere composed primarily of sulfur dioxide vapor. Simple microbes and plants may exist under these conditions. Both fire and metals are unavailable on this sort of world.

Edenworld: A terrestrial planet with a carbon-based, oxygen-breathing, water-solvent ecology highly compatible with Terran life. Roll again on the Habitable Worlds table.

Fumeworld: A waterless planet with a corrosive atmosphere dominated by nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide, possibly with seas of nitric acid. Metallurgy would be hard to develop on this sort of world.

Gas Giant: The ecosystem involves ammonia-based, methane-breathing balloon-like floaters that expel helium and retain hydrogen to stay aloft in the turbulent upper atmosphere of a Jovian world.

Hotbox: A waterless Venus-like planet with a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and very high temperatures. Such a world is almost certainly lifeless, the victim of its runaway greenhouse effect.

Iceworld: An outer-zone world with a surface composed mainly of water or ammonia ice. It may have a liquid ocean beneath the icy surface, with sufficient radiant energy penetrating via cracks to photodissociate water into hydrogen and oxygen to drive biological processes, or geothermal vents providing the energy for life.

Lushworld: A warm world with a carbon dioxide atmosphere, rich in plant life. Roll again on the Habitable Worlds table.

Marginal World: A world with an ecology in which Terran life is viable but at a disadvantage, due to local competition, rigorous conditions, or some combination. Roll again on the Habitable Worlds table.

Neonworld: A relatively large terrestrial world with an atmosphere rich in the dense but chemically inert noble gas neon, allowing large flying creatures to exist if life develops. Roll again on the Habitable Worlds table.

Quartzworld: This world has seas of sulfuric acid and a surface that resembles the area surrounding an earthly hot spring, with quartz and clay minerals serving as the habitat for silicon-oxygen (silicone)-based life forms.

Rockworld: A lifeless planet with at most a thin carbon dioxide atmosphere, like Mars or Luna.

Scumworld: A world inhabited only by microbes, similar to that of the ancient Earth of the Archaean Eon. The atmosphere is probably composed of mainly carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water vapor. On Earth, the evolution of blue-green algae or cyanobacteria, which produced oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis, initiated a dramatic transformation of Earth’s ecosystem. It is possible that such an ecosystem may comprise one vast planet-wide organism.

Smogworld: A terrestrial world whose oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere includes significant traces of chlorine generated by biological processes, producing a slightly toxic and corrosive gas mixture as well as mildly acidic and bleachy bodies of water, which local life forms can usually tolerate—except in shallow pools or muddy “acid flats” where toxic concentrations are higher—by virtue of their plastic-like composition but which visitors must find ways of dealing with. An intelligent civilization on such a corrosive world would have a tough time developing metallic tools, but might come up with ceramic-based electrochemical technology.

Archipelago World: An oceanic world characterized by numerous island chains but no large continental landmasses.

Artificial World: A world or worldlet quite obviously built as a habitat, rather than having formed naturally. Possibilities range from gigantic Dyson spheres, ringworlds, or tubeworlds—rotating tubes spun around a central star like a ball of hollow spaghetti—made of some incredible high-tensile-strength alien material to orbital habitats hollowed out of asteroids or built from dismantled comets and used as massive generation ships.

Canyon Planet: A world whose surface is cracked or carved into a network of canyons, with the most congenial habitats—at least for humanity—occurring along the walls of the cliff faces.

Crater Planet: A world whose surface features are clearly the product of numerous asteroid strikes, which resulted in circular depressions separated by long, narrow, curved ridges. The depressions may be filled with water, with the narrow ridges providing habitable surface, or they may be habitable lowlands, with the ridges constraining movement between separate ecospheres.

Desert Planet: A dry and arid world, with little to no surface water available.

Fungus Planet: A world characterized by fungal life forms that produce strange spores with a variety of functions and effects.

Forest World: A world dominated by gigantic tree-like organisms that serve as the foundation to a planetary ecology.

Ice Planet: A frozen world, its surface covered by glaciers and other large bodies of ice.

Jungle Planet: A world of incredible fecundity, thickly vegetated with large tree-like flora.

Radio Planet: A world inhabited by species that sense and communicate in an unusual zone of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Savannah Planet: A world of temperate and tropical grassland, well watered and inhabited by a robust ecology of grazers and predators.

Special Planet: A planet that is special or unusual in some way. It may have a highly eccentric orbit that produces seasonal extremes, may be tidally locked so that one hemisphere always faces its primary and the other always faces away (a twilight world), may have extremely high but perhaps barely human-tolerable gravity (a heavyworld, as in Hal Clement’s _Mission of Gravity_), or may not be a planetary surface at all—possibilities include the upper atmosphere of a gas giant (as in Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen’s _Wheelers_ or Iain Banks’s _The Algebraist_), a habitable nebula (a cohesive gas cloud in a system’s habitable zone, as in Larry Niven’s _The Integral Trees_), or a neutron star (à la Robert L. Forward’s _Dragon’s Egg_ or Stephen Baxter’s _Flux_).

Swamp Planet: A world of marshy, water-logged bogs and shallow seas inhabited by a varied and interconnected array of plant and animal species, or of muddy plains and algal mats.

Volcano Planet: A world with high amounts of tectonic activity and volcanism, producing large areas of flowing lava and thick clouds of ash in the atmosphere.

Water World: A world entirely covered by ocean, with little to no solid land anywhere.

## Planetary Conditions

### Terrestrial Worlds

Terrestrial worlds can range in size from the very small—an asteroid or “planetesimal”—to the very large: “super-Earths” of about five to ten Earth masses and up to about twice its radius.

#### Surface Gravity

Roll four dice, with a Mediocre (+0) roll indicating approximately Earth-like surface gravity. Rolls above indicate the difficulty of the Physique overcome actions needed to withstand the stresses of high gravity—for example, a Fair (+2) roll means Fair (+2) difficulty. Rolls below indicate the magnitude of difficulty of Athletics overcome actions needed to avoid awkward movement in low gravity—for example, a Poor (-1) roll means Average (+1) difficulty.

#### Orbital Eccentricity and Axial Tilt

These characteristics determine the variability of the planet’s climate—its seasons. A planet in a circular orbit around its primary star with its rotational axis perpendicular to its orbital plane will have no seasons, just a single steady climate all year round. As the orbit becomes more elliptical, the time of year will affect how much energy the planet receives from its primary star.

It is possible to imagine a planet with a highly elliptical orbit such that its surface freezes over and life on the planet must hibernate or find other ways of dealing with the deep freeze, only to experience a violent spring thaw and extraordinary summer blossoming before the temperature cools again.

A world with the aspect **Extreme Axial Tilt** might indicate that its lengths of day and night will vary more with latitude and time of year. Once the planet’s pole lies in the plane of the ecliptic, so that the planet is just sort of rolling along in its orbit, most of one hemisphere will experience permanent daylight while most of the other will experience permanent night while the planet’s tropics experience more-or-less perpetual twilight. This behavior is similar to but not identical to tidal locking.

Roll four dice. A Mediocre (+0) result means that the planet is in a circular orbit with relatively upright attitude. Deviations from that result reflect increasing eccentricity or tilt and thus greater temperature and climate variability, which can be taken as the difficulty of overcome actions related to survival and construction on the planet’s surface.

#### Surface Temperature

A planet in the inner zone of a star will have a high temperature, one in the outer zone will have a low temperature, and one in the habitable zone will have a temperature somewhere in between, all other things being equal.

For the planet’s average surface temperature, roll four dice, adding six if the planet is in the inner zone, or subtracting six if it’s in the outer zone. A Mediocre (+0) result indicates an Earth-like temperature range, negative results indicating colder temperatures, and positive results indicating higher temperatures. The deviation in steps away from Mediocre (+0) can be used as the difficulty for survival actions, such as Physique overcome actions to withstand temperature extremes in the short term or Engineering overcome actions to design and build adequate protective equipment in the long term.

### Jovian Worlds

A gas giant typically consists of a metallic or rocky core of sufficient mass to attract and retain a thick gaseous atmosphere of hydrogen, helium, and other gases. The pressures and temperatures in the depths of the planet’s atmosphere are enormous, but it is possible to imagine entire ecosystems floating at different levels of the gas giant’s atmosphere.

## Planetary Culture and Civilization

Based on what is known about a world so far, you might describe the sort of sentient species that lives there. Are they technologically sophisticated? What sorts of things do they value or abhor? Are they communal or individualistic? Are they gregarious or territorial?

### Planetary Culture

Create three to five aspects defining the species’ general culture. A member of that culture may choose up to three of those aspects and for each one either **embrace** it, taking it as their own, or **reject** it, writing a replacement aspect that reflects their rejection of their culture.

### Planetary Civilization

You can use the Bronze Rule to give relevant skills to a planetary civilization. Your approach in representing a whole world could vary from game to game, but a simple system might define a planetary civilization with three skills. Generally, the Bronze Rule will be used to define planets more often in games with epic tone, as characters interact with larger-scale entities. The typical range for such skills is Mediocre (+0) to Legendary (+8). To determine it randomly, roll four dice and add four.

*   Extent: How much of the planet and its surrounding system does the civilization occupy? This might represent the resilience of the civilization, giving it stress boxes or otherwise showing how much damage it can take in the face of threats of an appropriate scale. Additionally, extent is a measure of the resources available to the civilization.
*   Technology: How sophisticated and advanced is the civilization’s command of material and energy-producing technology? This reflects the difficulty of overcoming its military and technical defenses and protections.
*   Culture: How sophisticated and robust are the civilization’s art, philosophy, and other forms of expression? This reflects the difficulty of overcoming its legal system and other governmental controls, enticing or otherwise taking advantage of gullible or careless citizens on a wide scale.

## Interplanetary Trade and Commerce

Trade is a good reason for characters to travel from planet to planet, and the itinerant space merchant is a classic sci-fi trope, from Nicholas van Rijn in Poul Anderson’s _Trader to the Stars_ to _Star Trek’s_ tribble-peddling Cyrano Jones in the episode “The Trouble with Tribbles,” as well as Vernor Vinge’s STL trading culture, the Qeng Ho, in _A Deepness in the Sky_.

If spacecraft can travel between planets, the opportunity for trade will exist. Economic theory states that if it’s cheaper for a planet to import some valuable good than to produce it locally, it will try to import those valuables and export some quantity of locally produced goods in exchange, all other things being equal.

Within a star system, at interplanetary distances, it’s easy to imagine a sort of center-periphery trading model, where the resource-rich fringes of the system send raw materials to industrial centers of production to be turned into finished goods of various kinds, which are then sold to both local and distant markets.

However, the cost of transporting goods across interstellar distances at sub-light speeds is really daunting, so it may be the case that only really, really rare and valuable items are worth shipping across the stars. If relatively cheap FTL travel becomes available, then interstellar trade becomes a possibility once more. Alternately, an alien civilization may be ideologically committed to notions of gift exchange or ceremonial generosity as a status marker, and so will be willing to engage in what looks like unprofitable trade for the social cachet it brings them within their own circles.

When PC merchants arrive at a port of call, determine the commodities available for trade. Depending on your setting, you can determine these by rolling some world-scale skill such as Tech Level or Natural Resources; alternately, the GM can simply invent a handful of offerings. In any case, you can often define cargo with a single aspect describing what it is.

If you’d like more ideas for doing space commerce, check out _Pax Galactica_.

## Creating Aliens

Here’s a quick and fun way for players at the table to create an alien culture. If you’d like more discussion on making aliens of different plausibilities, read the following sections.

Whenever a character mentions the name of a new alien species or society, pause the game. Going around the table, each player names a feature of human beings’ physiological or psychological makeup, creating an aspect like **Diurnal**, **Breathes Air**, or **Individual Mind**. Then everyone at the table rolls four dice.

The player with the third highest roll chooses one of those aspects to keep unchanged.

The player with the second highest roll chooses a second aspect, and twists it by adding an exception, like **Diurnal Except in Summer** or **Individual Mind Except When Pregnant**, or by intensifying it, like **Breathes Air and Water**.

The player with the highest roll chooses a third aspect to reverse or replace altogether, like **Flies Easily, but Needs Augmentation to Walk Long Distances**, **Engages in Casual Reproductive Sex**, or **Cannot Eat with Others**.

Give these three aspects to the new alien species or society. If necessary, you can also identify some alien invocations and compels.

You’ll find another example way to create aliens for interstellar travelers to meet in _Millennials_.

### Low-Plausibility Aliens

These aliens are merely humans in funny makeup; that is to say, aside from a few cosmetic differences, they are at least psychologically indistinguishable from humans. A single aspect is usually all that’s necessary to establish the character as an alien, regardless of how alien the character actually is. For example, a **Martian in Disguise** is passing for human, while a **Cat-Headed Alien** is obviously not human, and a **Silicon Life Form** may not even be recognizable as a living being.

Other than that, however, each character’s alienness matters only insofar as its aspect is invoked or compelled, and the fact that the character is an alien may not even be part of its aspect. The character is a comic-book alien, like Superman, or a space-opera one, like everyone in the Mos Eisley cantina.

If you need to come up with a low-plausibility alien on the fly, roll four dice on this table one or more times.

</table>

Achatinoid (Snail-Like): This species resembles some form of gastropod, perhaps ambulating by means of a muscular ventral foot or possessing sensory organs at the ends of tentacular stalks. It may possess a shell.

Anguilliform (Eel-Like): This species has eel-like features.

Arachnoid (Spider-Like): This species has spider-like features.

Avian (Bird-Like): This species can fly, or is descended from a flying species. Alternately, it may merely be feathered or beaked.

Bicephalous (Two-Headed): This species has two heads, or seems to.

Centauroid: This species has a distinct anterior body or torso, usually with two or more manipulator limbs (arms), and a posterior body or barrel, usually with four or more ambulating limbs (legs).

Cetacean: This species resembles a whale or dolphin.

Exotic: This species is really bizarre from a human perspective. It may be microscopic or gargantuan, comprise multiple quasi-independent suborganisms within a larger hive mind, be parasitic upon or commensal with a host species, be an immaterial energy being, or be whatever else pushes against the limits of the setting.

Fungoid: This species resembles a terrestrial fungus. It may be spore-producing and rhizomatic, be comprised of an interwoven mass of tubular filaments, possess a chitinous integument, or otherwise remind a terrestrial observer of a mushroom, mold, or yeast.

Humanoid: This species resembles human beings, at least in general form.

Insectoid: This species has insect-like features.

Mammalian: This species has similarities with some species of terrestrial mammal. Roll two dice or choose—<span>-- feline (cat-like); <span>-0 leonine (lion-like) or vulpine (fox-like); <span>-+ ursine (bear-like); <span>00 equine (horse-like) or bovine (cow-like); <span>0+ porcine (pig-like); <span>++ canine (dog-like) or lupine (wolf-like).</span></span></span></span></span></span>

Octopoid: This species resembles a terrestrial squid or octopus, probably because it has many tentacles it uses for locomotion, manipulation, or both.

Reptilian: This species resembles a lizard or dinosaur, with scaly skin.

Simian (Ape-Like): This species resembles some form of ape or monkey.

### Medium-Plausibility Aliens

These aliens are _romantically_ designed; that is, they are imagined as a contrast to some human feature or trait, or as a slippery-slope exemplar of taking some human process or dynamic to an extreme.

Their exaggerated or contrasting features will often be explicitly called out as an aspect in describing the species, such as **Extreme Innate Code of Honor**, **Collective Hive Mind**, **No Sexual Dimorphism**, or **Egg-Laying**. Other aspects of the species may simply be science-fictional color, such as **Heavily Muscled, Three-Fingered Bipeds** or **Androgynous Grey-Skinned Humanoids**.

An example of medium-plausibility aliens is H. Beam Piper’s Fuzzies, from _Little Fuzzy_ and its sequels. These aliens are **Appealingly Playful Golden-Furred Aliens** that have been **Categorized by Humans as Nonintelligent** because they **Don’t Use Tools or Fire** and **Don’t Seem to Have Language**, allowing the author to explore questions of sentience and responsibility.

### High-Plausibility Aliens

These aliens are _realistically_ designed, imagined as the output of some evolutionary process that exerted selection pressures, creating beings with a particular physiology and psychological makeup, adapted to a particular ecological niche and with concomitant cultural predispositions. If there were a science called xenology, its job would be to describe aliens in these terms.

The alien nature of high-plausibility aliens will most always be part of their high concept, as it is a central feature, and can often be compelled to underscore an alien mentality that is rational but inhuman—in other words, adapted to the particular circumstances and conditions under which the aliens evolved and currently live. It’s often worthwhile to come up with a list of example alien invocations and compels for high-plausibility aliens upon their introduction. Their alien nature may also give them access to extras such as alien-only skills and stunts.

One example of interesting high-plausibility aliens is the Moties of Niven and Pournelle’s _The Mote in God’s Eye_ and its sequels, with their **Asymmetrical Third Gripping Hand**, their **Population Overdrive**, and their penchant for **Ad Hoc Engineering**.

Begin by describing the species’ **crèch****e planet**, where the alien species evolved, and which may or may not be its current homeworld or where it is encountered by PCs. Here is a short table of possible crèche planets.

Keeping the crèche planet in mind, answer the following questions and write one or two aspects based on those answers. These aspects will define the norm for the alien species, society, or subculture, depending on why you are creating the alien.

*   Alien Physiology: What physical features distinguish these aliens? How are these features connected to their intelligence, tool use, or other capabilities?
*   Alien Psychology: What distinctive attitudes or mental features characterize these aliens? What personality traits are regarded as typical or normal for them?
*   Alien Society: How are the aliens organized and governed? What principles guide their interactions and dealings with each other?
*   Alien Culture: What ideas, practices, or material objects are valued by these aliens? What meanings do they have to the aliens?
*   Alien History: What events greatly impacted the course of the aliens’ lives or their sense of place in the universe and their relationships with each other and with other species?

##### Example High-Plausibility Aliens: The Leonids of Alaxor 12

Alaxor 12 is a jungle planet that is known as the source of consciousness-expanding drugs used in local religious ceremonies, and so serves as a site of spiritual pilgrimage for many galactic citizens. The planetary natives thus include local mystagogues willing to introduce visitors to the ceremonies as well as disapproving religious purists.

*   Alien Physiology: The natives are a bipedal species of **Dimorphic Polygamous Carnivores** where males are characterized by **Ornate Status-Signaling Manes** and **Corpulent Hypermuscular Bodies** while females tend to be **Wiry Endomorphs**.
*   Alien Psychology: Male leonids tend to be **Territorial**, **Status-Conscious**, and **Sentimental**, while female leonids tend to be **Cooperative**, **Clan-Conscious**, and **Cold-Blooded**. The females do most of the hunting of prey, while the males engage in elaborate status rituals to defend and augment their own territories.
*   Alien Society: The leonid mystagogues are an **Ascetic Society of Monastic Spiritualists** and exist as a distinct subculture within the larger leonid society, which tends to be divided along gender lines. In contrast, the mystagogues are **Egalitarian in Outlook** and thus **Regarded with Suspicion by Larger Leonid Soc****iety**.
*   Alien Culture: Within the subculture of the leonid mystagogues, the **Spirit Hunt Ritual**, a hallucinatory trance enabled by the rare and costly **Spider-Orchid Poison**, is a central experience. Successful completion of the ritual is said to produce a feeling of union with nature and with others, heightened self-awareness, and greater empathy and interpersonal understanding.
*   Alien History: Throughout leonid history, Spirit Hunt ritualism has been a recurring heresy because of how it challenges traditional leonid modes of being. The **Planetary Patriarch and His Council of Wives** have recently promulgated **Laws Against the Spirit** **Hunt** that make it illegal to traffic in spider-orchid poison, with territorial dispossession as punishment. The enforcement of these laws has created a class of **Leonid Spirit Hunter Refugees** who entice off-worlders with an entheogenic trip by means of illegally obtained spider-orchid poison.
