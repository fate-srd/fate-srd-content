<h1 id="nothing-about-us-without-us">Nothing About Us Without Us</h1>
<p>In this book, we talk about all sorts of disabilities, from visible to invisible, from mental illness to people who
  use wheelchairs. We talk about the mechanics of how adaptive devices work in game, and how they work on a practical
  level. Basically, we get into as many specifics as possible.</p>
<p>We can’t go over every disability on the planet; that would be futile. When you look at the text in <em>The Nitty
    Gritty of Specific Disabilities</em> (page XX), it’s important to know a couple of things. Every disability has been
  addressed by someone who knows the topic because they live it. Lillian has schizophrenia and synesthesia; Elsa is
  blind, deaf, and has PTSD (yup, it’s a fun diagnostic party). This is deliberate; personal experience gives you better
  insight into how to play a character than a medical text can. It also means our advice might be flawed.</p>
<p><em>Gaming With Disabilities</em> (page XX) gives you more information about how to do the research and learn from
  other people without hurting anyone, and it’ll help you bring people who already have disabilities to your table.</p>
<p>Some of what’s said here may feel like you’re being told what not to do, which isn’t necessarily the most Fate-y
  thing ever. The goal here is to help you (the player and the GM) come to a better place where disability inclusion
  looks more like it should—a way to experience new stories without the burden of harmful tropes. Sometimes the only way
  to do that is to stop doing the things you’ve always done before.</p>

  <h4 id="sidebar-on-saying-no-">Sidebar: On Saying “No”</h4>
  <p><em>Brian is one of the system and mechanics developers for this book! He pops in and out with ways to flesh out
      your mechanics from a Fate-y perspective.</em></p>
  <p>As Elsa said, some of the text in this book likely feels like we’re telling you what not to do, and that might feel
    contrary to the ethos of Fate. You’re supposed to say “yes,” aren’t you?</p>
  <p>Here’s the thing: Fate is a respectful game. We don’t tackle topics if we can’t tackle them in a respectful way,
    and when we do tackle topics—especially sensitive, difficult topics—we do it with the goal of not causing harm.
    Sometimes that works, and sometimes it doesn’t.</p>
  <p>This book aims to help your table do this for a specific set of topics. We want everyone to have fun, but in a way
    that doesn’t hurt anyone or make anyone feel like they are less important.</p>
  <p>So try this trick: if you write an aspect or a stunt or whatever and someone else at the table says, “Hey, that
    aspect kind of hurts me. Do you mind changing it?” don’t approach that as them saying “no” to you. Approach it as an
    opportunity for you to learn, to come up with a better, more respectful way to express what you’re trying to
    express, or to realize that sometimes a trope is just plain harmful and shouldn’t be used at the table.</p>
  <p>Remember that everyone at the table is there to have fun, and if something you do is causing someone pain or
    discomfort, you’re getting in the way of their fun. It’s okay for the table to say “no” to that kind of behavior.
    Because Fate is a respectful game.</p>

<h2 id="a-short-list-of-things-you-may-not-have-considered">A Short List of Things You May Not Have Considered</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Disabled people don’t always want to be cured.</li>
  <li>Not all disabilities have a cure.</li>
  <li>The Disability Binary is a lie. Most disabilities exist on a sliding scale. Not all blind people are totally
    blind, not all D/deaf people are totally D/deaf, a person in a wheelchair may be able to stand and walk short
    distances.</li>
  <li>An adaptive device is a tool, sometimes an extension of or replacement for a body part. It is not a toy or a prop
    or a thing to be mocked.</li>
  <li>Disability can be part of your identity, but it isn’t all of you either. Disabled people are Jewish, PoC, gay,
    straight, trans… Disabled people are just that. Complex people.</li>
  <li>Pain is relative. Some kinds of pain don’t even rate for someone who has it all the time.</li>
  <li>Disability is not one size fits all; it looks different on everyone, and everyone who has a disability handles
    their own differently. Even people with the same disability don’t all handle it in the exact same way.</li>
  <li>Not all disabilities are visible. You might play a character with an invisible disability—their experience is
    still a disabled one.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="language-and-identity">Language and Identity</h2>
<p>There are a few different ways that people with disabilities talk about ourselves. Some prefer person first language.
  What does that mean? It’s very simple: It means the word “person” goes before the disability, such as “a man with
  depression.” Some people feel that it helps them maintain their identity as a “person first, disability second.” Other
  people, including myself (Elsa), prefer to be called a blind woman or a disabled woman. It’s a matter of preference
  and practice. In my case, because I have never known a body other than a disabled one to be mine, I choose the
  language of disabled first. However, gaining a disability later in life does not mean that you would prefer person
  first language. When you’re creating a character with a disability, consider what language they might prefer or, for
  that matter, the language preferred for the world you’re playing in.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-aspects">A Note on Aspects</h2>
<p>A cornerstone of Fate is that you can choose the aspects that interest you as a player, and choose language that
  suits your thinking. Since good aspects can be compelled as well as invoked, phrase aspects in a useful, flexible way.
  A character might be <strong>Strong</strong>, but they might also be <strong>Built Like a Tank</strong> or
  <strong>Tiny but Mighty</strong>. The actual wording of the aspect is just the anchor point to hang your understanding
  of the character on. Consider jotting down a description of how the aspect is supposed to work, both when invoked and
  when compelled. After all, even aspects like <strong>Amazon Princess</strong> or <strong>World’s Greatest
    Detective</strong> can use a little description to nail down what they cover.</p>
<p>We hope this book helps you apply the same richness of thought to tweaking straightforward aspects like <strong>Blind
    Swordsman</strong> (like Zatoichi) or <strong>Depressed Green Monster</strong> (like Shrek) or <strong>Anxious Blue
    Thought</strong> (like Sadness from <em>Inside Out</em>). While this book provides more colorful aspects that might
  be used in lieu of those, more importantly, it provides tools to allow you to have a richer understanding of the
  <strong>idea</strong> you’re expressing. We’re not looking to police “good” and “bad” aspects, only to suggest that
  the more you understand, the better the experience will be for you and for everyone you play with.</p>
<p>GMs, never compel an aspect in such a way that it takes a player character out of the flow of the story. For example,
  do not compel an <strong>Agoraphobic</strong> to force a player to hide in a corner while the action is unfolding in a
  vast train station. Instead, provide ideas of choices that will lead to more possibilities for the character. For
  example, you can hold up a fate point and suggest: “Do you think your agoraphobia would drive you to seek a safe spot
  somewhere? The station master ran out of the office when the second alarm rang, and the ‘Employees only’ door is
  slightly ajar…”</p>
<h2 id="heroism-and-overcoming">Heroism and Overcoming</h2>
<p>We encourage you to use the <em>Fate Accessibility Toolkit</em> to explore playing characters with disabilities in
  heroic situations. Rewrite the <strong>overcoming narrative</strong>—the narrative that as a disabled person you’re
  heroic because you manage to get out your front door. This is one of the narratives we’re trying to encourage players
  to leave behind, telling new stories. Always push to have your characters with disabilities be part of the story as
  people first—not because they’re disabled, but because they’re heroes.</p>
<h1 id="gaming-with-disabilities">Gaming With Disabilities</h1>
<p>Whether you’re playing a disabled character, creating a character with disabilities, GMing for disabled characters,
  or making your gaming space more accessible and welcoming for disabled players, this section covers a lot of things
  you should think about.</p>
<h2 id="playing-characters-with-disabilities">Playing Characters With Disabilities</h2>
<p>The way disabilities are expressed in Fate Core comes from the choices you make in character and the way you use your
  skills to navigate the world around you. You won’t necessarily narrate using your white cane on the pavement unless it
  matters in the story, but you might narrate the experience of trying to find a clue with your hands and not your eyes.
  Your character in a wheelchair has the Athletics skill, but it’s used for other ways of getting around than running
  and jumping. When playing a character with disabilities within Fate, avoid embodying that character by using a prop;
  rather, shift the way you think about interacting with the world at large.</p>
<h3 id="physical-disabilities">Physical Disabilities</h3>
<p>Most people are familiar with the disabilities you assume you can see—those that require mobility devices or exterior
  help. They’re often the disabilities that people stare at, because they see something as different from them. Some of
  the disabilities covered in this book include blindness, deafness, paralysis, and amputation. The fact is, not all
  these disabilities <em>are</em> visible, though. A blind person might wear glasses, or they might only be blind in one
  eye and not both. A <strong>D/deaf</strong> person might wear invisible hearing aids, or have a cochlear implant. All
  these things change the visible nature of disability—and that’s before we get future tech involved!</p>
<p>Physical disabilities likely affect play the most in terms of physical actions—everything from being able to notice
  objects or find clues, to running from a pack of slavering beasts.</p>
<blockquote>
  <h4 id="sidebar-capital-d-or-lowercase-d-">Sidebar: Capital D or lowercase d?</h4>
  <p>The term D/deaf is used to describe people across the spectrum of deafness and of participation in Deaf Culture. A
    person who is a “capital D Deaf” person likely uses sign language either as their primary language or to the
    exclusion of orally spoken language. A person with the “little d” designation likely uses oral language skills,
    lipreading, and hearing aids. D/deaf is often used as a shortcut to describe both groups who are similar but not
    exactly the same when it comes to communication.</p>
  <p>Hard of hearing (HoH) refers to those who have trouble hearing some sounds; this can range from mild to severe and
    is often helped by amplification devices such as hearing aids. There’s a medical definition with a firm delineation,
    but culturally and personally the lines are more blurry. How do you know if someone is hard of hearing or deaf or
    Deaf? It depends on how they personally identify themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="invisible-disabilities">Invisible Disabilities</h4>
<p>An invisible disability may not be apparent at first blush—a condition which, for better or worse, isn’t seen as a
  part of you at a glance. Many of these disabilities are still physical in nature by the way they affect the body, but
  aren’t obvious at first sight.</p>
<p>It should be made clear that these disabilities are not things that someone could make up, or convince oneself of
  within the context of mental illness. Both mental illness and invisible disabilities are valid, and real, and things
  which should be taken seriously, not questioned for their validity. Unfortunately, this is a common reaction to such
  disabilities, especially ones around pain or around neurotypicality.</p>
<blockquote>
  <h4 id="sidebar-multiple-disabilities">Sidebar: Multiple Disabilities</h4>
  <p>Each disability could be coupled with other disabilities. However, as someone who lives with three disabilities, I
    can tell you that it’s not an easy path—I don’t recommend it unless you have extensive understanding of all the
    disabilities in your character’s background.</p>
  <p>However, there may be occasions where it seems fitting to have two disabilities overlap from the same cause. In
    this case, it may be wisest to start with the cause—an accident, an illness, etc.—and identify a few consequences.
    For example, a character who survived a serious car wreck may have a mobility disability and also have PTSD which
    manifests primarily around travel and transit.</p>
  <p>Rather than develop a full set of aspects for each, you might take one aspect related to PTSD and focus the rest of
    the character’s disability-related mechanics on their mobility disability. Or consider that one disability may
    manifest as mechanics, while the rest are part of the narrative gameplay. Above all, remember that your character is
    a complex person and should not be defined primarily by their disabilities, even if they have several.</p>
  <p>See <em>Creating a Disabled Fate Character</em> (page XX) for suggestions on how to balance the mechanics.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="mental-illness">Mental Illness</h3>
<p>In game design we have a really difficult relationship with mental illness. Games don’t have a great track record for
  representing mental illness well, or for treating people who have mental illnesses with respect.</p>
<p>A lot of that has to do with the language that we use in creating games. Sanity checks. Games set in horrifying
  psychiatric facilities. Flaws or character defects that make mental illness look scarier than it is. All these things
  have made the game table a very shaky place to talk about mental health—but I hope this book can dispel a little bit
  of that bad faith. When discussing mental illnesses, we do our best to talk about not just what mental health can look
  like in games, but how it might affect your character for real, not as a joke or as a punchline, but as a way to
  develop your character. To help address these concerns, each of the mental illness sections has been written by a
  person who lives with the mental health condition listed.</p>
<p>It’s common and easy to assume we’re familiar with mental health conditions based on the oversimplified and often
  joking way they’re portrayed and talked about in everyday conversation. How often have you seen an offhand comment
  about OCD that describes it as a quirk and doesn’t account for the reality of what it means to live with it? If you
  play a character with a mental illness, consider doing an internet search of medical sources to get an idea of what a
  clinical diagnosis looks like. Not every mental illness plays out exactly the way that the diagnosis is written, but
  it’s a helpful piece of information for you to have. As a note, clinical diagnostic criteria sometimes change, and the
  definitions often alter how people identify. Having your diagnosis be a moving target is also something to consider,
  because it may make your character less sure of what exactly they live with.</p>
<blockquote>
  <h4 id="sidebar-don-t-diagnose-the-table">Sidebar: Don’t Diagnose the Table</h4>
  <p>Just because you’re given access to these tools to diagnose and play out your character’s mental illness does not
    mean you should use these tools to diagnose real live people. If you have concerns about a friend or family member’s
    mental health, consider giving them the tools to seek out help, rather than diagnosing them on your own.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="horror-and-mental-health">Horror and Mental Health</h4>
<p>When playing in a game that focuses on people’s realities being torn apart, such as Cthulhu Mythos-related games,
  players should pay attention to how trauma, or changes to the reality they ascribe to, affect them as a character.
  Rather than using “crazy” behavior to elicit humor, focus instead on how the things that shift your worldview change
  what you are and aren’t willing to do. A woman who believes so strongly in justice that she’s willing to do anything
  to uphold the law may have trouble looking herself in the mirror after having to kill a cultist who was attempting to
  sacrifice a virgin. A doctor who believes strongly in his Hippocratic oath might not be so comfortable with himself
  when he finds out that the body doesn’t actually work the way that he’s always learned it does. The worlds we create
  can have effects on the mental health of our characters without becoming a hilarious trope of what the media feeds us
  as comedy.</p>
<p>I see a lot of people playing “crazy” characters as the catharsis of humor in many horror games. They’re the ones who
  do silly things and who act like children; in that case mental illness is played as a trait that makes people
  unpredictable or funny. People will still do this—I can’t reach through the pages of this book and stop you—but I
  encourage you to consider how mental illness would actually affect a character running around in a world that no
  longer makes any sense.</p>
<h4 id="anchors-tracking-mental-trauma">Anchors: Tracking Mental Trauma</h4>
<p>The mind is complex, and a mechanic like sanity points or a random mental illness chart simplifies it in a way that
  can be reductive and insulting to people who actually live with mental illness. If you think your game needs such a
  mechanic, consider this as an alternative.</p>
<p>When creating characters, each player chooses five aspects: a high concept, a trouble, and three
  <strong>anchors</strong>. Those anchors are things that stabilize them, that give them comfort, that prevent them from
  spiraling into despair. They can be relationships, daily rituals they engage in, beliefs they hold, personal items or
  places that are very important to them, or a variety of other grounding forces.</p>
<p>Whenever a player wants a better roll but has no way to improve that roll—they’re out of fate points, they have no
  applicable stunts, or they simply don’t have any relevant aspects—they can <strong>risk an anchor</strong>. Doing so
  provides the benefit of invoking an aspect, but it comes with a catch: if the player succeeds on their roll, they must
  <em>change that anchor</em> by the end of the scene. The new anchor can be related or entirely new, provided that it
  makes sense within the context of the game. If the character fails their roll, nothing happens to their anchors; they
  simply suffer the effects of failure. A character can risk each anchor only once on a single roll.</p>
<p>This system is less about penalizing players or “damaging their sanity” when they’re exposed to horrific things and
  more about modeling how people change when exposed to horrors. It’s not explicitly for modeling mental illness, but it
  can be used to do so in a way that’s more organic and respectful than sanity points or a random mental illness chart.
</p>
<p>If you use this system, know that it relies heavily on depriving the players of fate points. Consider lowering
  players’ starting refresh and using compels sparingly.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-disabled-fate-character">Creating a Disabled Fate Character</h2>
<p>There are a number of ways to make a character with a disability and have the disability represented in game
  mechanics. The first step in all of those ways is to have one of your character aspects (possibly your high concept
  but it doesn’t have to be) establish the disability, such as <strong>Paraplegic Sleuth</strong> or <strong>Autistics
    Think Outside the Box</strong>. This alone shows that your character’s disability is a part of them that you’d like
  to explore. If that’s as far as you want to go, it’s absolutely enough.</p>
<h3 id="components-of-a-disability">Components of a Disability</h3>
<p>On the other hand, establishing a disability through an aspect opens up a wealth of options. These include additional
  aspects, stunts, conditions, and extras.</p>
<h4 id="aspects">Aspects</h4>
<p>You can make as many of your aspects as you wish incorporate your disability. Discussions of the various disabilities
  in <em>Fate Accessibility Toolkit</em> give plenty of example aspects specifically related to those disabilities, but
  some examples include:</p>
<p><strong>Blind Champion of Queen Iranthi:</strong> Invoke to gain a bonus in combat, take advantage of the fact that
  you know the Queen personally, or declare that the flickering firelight doesn’t bother you (because you can barely see
  it anyway). Compel when an opponent uses your limited vision against you or when you’d rather be taking care of a
  different problem but duty to the Queen calls you away.</p>
<p><strong>The Best Hearing Aids Fifty Bucks Can Buy:</strong> Invoke when you need to replace them inexpensively or
  when you need a bonus to hear that guy sneaking up on you. Compel when the cheap pieces of junk crackle with static or
  whistle with feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Former Wheelchair Basketball Olympian:</strong> Invoke to gain a bonus in a chase or when you need to throw
  an object, or when your determination never, ever to quit gets you through a tough spot. Compel when “never quit”
  means you throw good effort after bad, or when your rival from the Australian team shows up with some payback on her
  mind.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Earplugs:</strong> Invoke when you need to recover from an autistic meltdown or don’t want the
  incredibly loud sounds of that factory to stir up your migraine. Compel when your earplugs mean you don’t hear the
  warning your partner yells to you, or you miss that your phone is ringing.</p>
<h4 id="stunts">Stunts</h4>
<p>You can compose stunts related to your disability using your character’s usual stunt slots and refresh. Stunts can
  represent qualities of your disability, as well as adaptive devices (page XX) you use. See Fate Core&#39;s stunt
  chapter (<em>Fate Core System,</em> page 88) for extensive details about composing stunts, but some examples include:
</p>
<p><strong>Shotgun Prosthetic (Deceive):</strong> Your rigid prosthetic leg contains a shotgun barrel, triggered by a
  lever at your hip. When you’re seated, you may make an attack (with Weapon:3) using Deceive against a target in your
  zone that isn’t aware of this extra feature.</p>
<p><strong>Pain Tolerance (Physique):</strong> Your many years of dealing with chronic pain have made you resilient to
  physical punishment. Once per session, at the cost of a fate point, you can reduce the severity of a moderate
  consequence that’s physical in nature to a mild consequence (if your mild consequence slot is free), or erase a mild
  consequence altogether.</p>
<p><strong>Lip Reader (Notice):</strong> You are highly adept at reading lips. You gain +2 to overcome actions made with
  Notice to “eavesdrop” on someone from a distance, provided you can see their mouth.</p>
<h4 id="extras-and-conditions">Extras and Conditions</h4>
<p>Extras (<em>Fate Core System</em>, Chapter 11) can be used to represent some adaptive devices, such as wheelchairs or
  cybernetic implants. Most extras have a cost that you need to meet in order to take it, such as skill ranks in a
  certain skill or spending a stunt slot.</p>
<p>A <strong>condition</strong> is… well… a temporary condition that your character might find themself in. Conditions
  have special rules that come into effect when they’re active, and have a way to recover from them to deactivate those
  rules. We talk a lot about conditions on page XX.</p>
<h4 id="what-can-i-add-to-my-character-">What Can I Add To My Character?</h4>
<p>So, how many conditions, extras, and such can you take when you make your character? Your aspects, skills, and stunts
  work as usual. The parts of your disability represented by aspects, skills, and stunts fit into those frameworks no
  differently than non-disability related elements. Extras list a permission (typically an aspect) and a cost (typically
  a stunt slot or point of refresh, sometimes more). Many give you some free aspects and stunts, which don’t count
  against your usual slots. You can take as many extras as you can afford within that cost.</p>
<p>Conditions are a bit different. Some extras suggest (or even require) particular conditions, so take those, but we
  suggest that you take any that make sense to your conception of your character.</p>
<p>Remember that with the <em>Fate Accessibility Toolkit</em>, your aim should not be precise mechanical “balance,”
  where every disadvantage is evened-out by a concrete advantage somewhere else. Let your focus be on modeling in rules
  the parts of your character that you’d like to reflect in rules.</p>
<p>This goes for any mechanical part of the game, not just conditions. Game designers and writers who live with these
  disabilities have stressed throughout this book many times that every person’s disability is unique—so it would be
  ridiculous to have hard-and-fast rules about how, say, blindness works that apply the same way every time. Be
  flexible. Make the character on paper the way they are in your imagination.</p>
<h5 id="example-creating-ma-bell">Example: Creating Ma Bell</h5>
<p>Laurel is playing in a 90s-era Hackers game. Her high concept is <strong>Aspie Phone Phreaker</strong> who goes by
  “Ma Bell.” As a trouble aspect, Laurel decides her character has an <strong>I Can Do It!</strong> attitude which often
  gets her in over her head. Sometimes this could be related to an autistic fixation, but it’s more often a consequence
  of her curiosity and love of experimentation. Ma Bell pulls off her hijinks because she <strong>Hears in
    Patterns</strong> and uses devices to exactly mimic the sounds she needs. This is a cooler use of a real life way in
  which Laurel experiences her autism. Laurel reminds the GM that she isn’t playing a stereotypical savant or someone
  with superpowers; Ma Bell’s talent is in reproducing the patterns she hears.</p>
<p>Since Ma Bell uses homemade gadgets to phreak, Laurel creates the stunt Sonic Scrounger. With this stunt, she can
  identify potential components even when she’s separated from her electronic devices without spending a fate point.
  Making a new gadget still requires a Craft check. Laurel draws on her own experience of making people uncomfortable by
  observing things which fall outside social norms to develop the stunt I Can’t Help But Notice; it uses her character’s
  Notice in place of Provoke to create an advantage by unsettling or upsetting the target.</p>
<p>Laurel adds condition Meltdown to her sheet and tells the GM it’s generally triggered for her character by auditory
  stimuli. She considers whether she wants to take any assistive devices as aspects or extras. In everyday life, her
  partner acts as a service human. But she decides that her character is more of a loner and that her gadgets are all
  focused around her trade. She may invoke some of her real-life autistic traits in engaging with her gadgets, but she
  doesn’t feel it needs to be mechanical.</p>

##### Example: Creating Professor Jenkins

Elsa is creating Professor Jenkins, a blind super sleuth in a mystery campaign set in the 1920s. She takes the high
concept aspect <strong>Blind Mystery-Solving Literature Professor</strong> which establishes that she’s blind and is
extremely well-read and highly educated. Another of her aspects is <strong>Glasses Like Soda Bottles</strong>; Elsa
tells the GM that Jenkins has some vision in one eye but it’s limited to close-up work and then only with her strong
glasses.

Next, she composes this stunt to represent one of her items of adaptive technology, using one of her character’s three
free stunts:

* <strong>Magnifiers (Investigation):</strong> Professor Jenkins’s glasses have a jeweler’s magnification lens that she
can position in front of her usual lenses. With this lens, she gains +2 to overcome and create advantage Investigation
actions when examining objects close-up and looking for tiny details.

Finally, she likes the look of the extra called White Cane, and decides to add it to her character. The White Cane extra
costs one of her stunt slots (so that’s the second of the three free stunts), but it gives her two free stunts and an
additional aspect that are related to her cane. It also requires the Without My Device condition.

  Stunned</strong> to the target of your successful Fight attack made with the cane.

<strong>Trapfinder (Notice):</strong> You have optimized your cane for locating traps, snares, false floors, and other
pitfalls you might encounter while exploring ancient temples and ruins. Gain +2 to overcome actions with Notice to find
traps.

<strong>The Power of Deduction (Investigate):</strong> Once per scene you can spend a fate point (and a few minutes of
observation) to make a special Investigate roll representing your potent deductive faculties. For each shift you make on
this roll you discover or create an aspect, on either the scene or the target of your observations, though you may only
invoke one of them for free.

<h2 id="gming-for-disabled-characters">GMing for Disabled Characters</h2>
<p>So you’ve got all these new characters rolling around the table, and suddenly you need to adjust how you GM in order
  to tell the stories of disabled characters as well as you’ve told the stories of able bodied ones. The first thing to
  remember is that telling a story includes all the senses that characters might have access to. For example, if a blind
  character is at the table, you want to make sure to give their player excellent sensory directions like smell, taste,
  touch, and sound. The air can taste like blood if you’re used to paying attention to such things, for example.</p>
<p>One of the ways to think about this is also a great writing technique—look at a scene and take away a single sense
  for yourself, then consider all the ways it might be read from other sensory angles. If you can’t hear at all, a room
  full of people shouting might look very different, because you can’t contextualize the shouting by tone.</p>
<p>This also means that you need to know what’s in an area very well, or at least be prepared to elaborate on the fly.
  If you’ve got a character with a wheelchair, you might need to diversify the ways characters get into a building or
  around a space. If your players aren’t disabled, they may not know tricks to getting around or may not have thought
  about fantastical measures for getting a wheelchair into a building, so you need to be three steps ahead with possible
  solutions to move the story forward.</p>
<p>It is also totally reasonable to challenge your characters with disabilities in ways that a person with a disability
  would be challenged in real life, provided the player themself is not disabled. Having to play out scenarios that a
  player with a disability lives every day is boring, but giving able bodied players a chance to think through everyday
  solutions to problems is a reasonable part of play.</p>
<h2 id="disabilities-at-the-table">Disabilities at the Table</h2>
<p>Most of this book is dedicated to the question: How do I play disabled people in games? This section is about the
  other question I often get asked: How do I bring players with disabilities to my table? It focuses on bringing players
  with disabilities to our gaming tables without asking them to do the bulk of the work to figure out how to get there.
</p>
<p>The first few steps are really simple. Start with bright lights, comfortable chairs, and accessible materials such as
  large print dice, simpler character sheets with larger print, or even a tablet with a PDF of the game rules on it. On
  page page XX of this book you’ll find a large print character sheet for Fate Core, and on page XX you&#39;ll find a
  list of ASL signs for some basic RPG terms.</p>
<p>These are a start, but there’s more to do. Your table can’t just be accessible because you’re willing to play with
  people; it has to be accessible because you’ve made your table that way.</p>
<blockquote>
  <h4 id="sidebar-leveling-the-playing-field">Sidebar: Leveling the Playing Field</h4>
  <p>The world won’t always be perfectly accessible. We may not always have strong lighting, we may not be able to
    eradicate crosstalk at our tables, or completely eradicate harmful tropes.</p>
  <p>But we can try.</p>
  <p>We can try to create better gaming spaces, create better characters, develop better systems.</p>
  <p>We can make large print character sheets, and design mechanics that represent more people. We can stop using
    harmful tropes, and develop more content about disabled people.</p>
  <p>The best tool I can leave you with is to ask questions of your disabled peers. Want to play a D/deaf character? Ask
    somebody. Want to have a visually impaired or blind player at your table? Ask them what will make the game more
    comfortable for them.</p>
  <p>We didn’t cover a lot of disabilities in here, not because they aren’t important but because we only had so much
    space. Don’t assume that because we didn’t include them doesn’t mean they aren’t worthy of inclusion,
    representation, or support. Intellectually disabled gamers exist, gamers with MS, with muscular dystrophy, with ALS
    exist. They deserve representation and inclusion in our world.</p>
  <p>We can always do better.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="language">Language</h3>
<p>Inclusion and representation doesn’t just take place in the ways that we play our games, or with the characters we
  develop; it’s also about changing our culture to include people. We’re still fighting and learning how to include
  women and people of color in our games and at our tables, but disability is important too.</p>
<p>That fight starts with how you speak.</p>
<p>The real tool you need to create accessibility is knowing how to talk about access with your friends, players, and
  strangers. There’s language to be used for that, and there are better and worse ways to discuss these issues.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the basics of the language people use to describe themselves and their disabilities. There are two
  major theories that get used: Person First Language and Identity First Language. It’s safest to use Person First
  Language at first, when you don’t yet know someone’s preference. Once you’ve gotten to know someone for a while, I
  suggest asking your friend what language they use for their disability.</p>
<h4 id="person-first-language">Person First Language</h4>
<p>This is a pretty simple idea: put the word <em>person</em> before the word <em>disability</em> or the kind of
  disability involved. Person with a wheelchair, person with a disability (PWD for short).</p>
<h4 id="identity-first-language">Identity First Language</h4>
<p>I (Elsa) am an identity first user. I’m a blind woman. A disabled person. The identity of disability is important to
  who I am, and I can’t get rid of it. For me, person first language feels distancing, but for others it feels
  respectful. That’s why you should always ask!</p>
<h4 id="language-to-avoid">Language to Avoid</h4>
<p>Handicapable, special needs, and other cutesy ways to avoid disability are often viewed as harmful. They erase the
  need for language that says the word, they play into the need to pretend that disability doesn’t exist. People aren’t
  comfortable confronting disability as it is.</p>
<p><em>Special needs</em> is a term that particularly sticks with me, because my needs at the game table (or anywhere)
  aren’t special. It’s not special that I need a level playing field using adaptive devices. It’s not special treatment
  to ask for a different character sheet, or for everyone to use large print dice. It’s just how it is. When you adjust
  your language to believe that these are needed changes, and not <em>special</em>, you’re acknowledging equality with
  your words.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-safe-environment">Creating a Safe Environment</h3>
<p>It goes without saying that the environment needs to be physically safe for all players, so here we’re talking about
  making your table a place where the players feel safe to engage with the game and with other players.</p>
<p>First, it’s important to set the tone for your table by talking about people’s expectations and things that won’t be
  accepted at your table, like playing disabilities for laughs or scenes with violence against children. Talk about
  things that the players do and don’t want to experience—you are also one of those players, so make your own wishes
  known, both for your comfort and to set an example to encourage others to share as well. If your players are expecting
  a swashbuckling adventure, they may be caught unawares by a dark dungeon crawl with a high likelihood of death. If a
  player has a spider phobia, maybe rethink the plan to have them enter a haunted house full of spiders; maybe another
  creature would be just as creepy without touching on deep-seated fears. See “Trigger Warnings” on page XX for more on
  this.</p>
<p>Despite your best attempts at trying to avoid in-game situations that make your players uncomfortable, sometimes a
  player (including you) may find the game heading in an unwelcome direction. There are a few strategies for dealing
  with this in the game as it happens. The two we talk about here are the X-Card and Script Change.</p>
<h4 id="the-x-card">The X-Card</h4>
<p>John Stavropoulos’ creation of the X-Card has made it possible to have a physical representation of the trigger
  warning on every gaming table we sit at. The X-Card acts as a way to remove ourselves from a scene or situation that
  might be uncomfortable, for whatever reason. Many people use it to avoid having to engage in any kind of roleplay they
  might not be comfortable with (any kind of sexual scene with someone they don’t know well, for example), while others
  use it to avoid any material that might be triggering for a psychological disorder such as PTSD.</p>
<p>The X-Card creates a way to signal safely without having to explain yourself to a table of potential strangers. It
  means that if you want to play a game with people you don’t know, you don’t have to explain your whole life history
  before sitting down. Some detractors of the X-Card say that it just allows people to find out what your weaknesses
  are, but that would be an abuse of the dynamic that the card represents.</p>
<p>The X-Card and trigger warnings are intended to create an environment where any theme can be explored, or where any
  theme can be expressly avoided if necessary. The ideal is, of course, that all players feel comfortable within the
  space.</p>
<p>The X-Card is particularly suited to conventions, game day events, and other situations where the participants may
  not know one another all that well and where time for discussion of sensitive issues may be limited. You can learn
  more about the X-Card on page XX.</p>
<h4 id="script-change">Script Change</h4>
<p>Brie Beau Sheldon’s Script Change RPG Toolbox is more suited to ongoing games between people who know one another and
  have built a level of trust. Often it’s good to discuss with your group a “rating” for your game content, however
  sometimes people don’t know their boundaries yet. Maybe they do, and they just aren’t expecting to kick down the door
  and find something that really makes them scared or uncomfortable. This is where Script Change comes in.</p>
<p>At any point during the game, if a player or game master (GM) finds that they are uncomfortable with the subject
  matter or actions happening in the game, they can call for a Script Change. To make things easier, the GM should write
  “Rewind,” “Fast Forward,” and “Pause” on individual index cards or print out the sample Script Change cards in the
  Appendix of this book. You can learn more about Script Change on page XX.</p>
<h4 id="trigger-warnings">Trigger Warnings</h4>
<p>Trigger warnings are another method of assisting players with potential mental health concerns around a table.
  Instead of asking your players to air their concerns in front of one another (which the X-Card forces you to do to
  some extent) you can always offer to have conversations with your players individually about their triggers or topical
  concerns when it comes to subject matter. You don’t have to even have a mental health concern to have something you
  don’t want to come up in game. For example, I really prefer my horror without eyeball trauma.</p>
<p>Another way to use the trigger warning or content warning is to tell your players ahead of time at the top of a
  session that “these are the themes we might get into at the table today” and then letting people opt out if they need
  to. Giving people the information that <em>Wraith: The Oblivion</em> contains themes of violent death might seem
  redundant, but not everyone is going to be aware. Giving everyone equal opportunity to sit down at the table and enjoy
  a game is valuable.</p>
<h3 id="all-access-gaming">All Access Gaming</h3>
<p>The philosophy to which I subscribe, and the reason I wrote this book, can be called “all access gaming.” Ideally our
  hobby will eventually be radically accessible, a place in which no matter if you can hear, see, or walk, you can still
  play in any game you want.</p>
<p>This doesn’t just apply to the table at your home. It applies to the gaming stores we go to and the publishers we buy
  from. Asking for access needs to come not just from the disabled gamers who request it, but from their friends who
  want to be able to play with them. All access gaming means that we’ve busted open the hobby as wide as we can and told
  everyone that they can come roll the dice with us.</p>
<p>A lot of people ask why gamers should care about equal representation for disabled gamers. After all, if you’re not
  disabled those stories aren’t obviously fun to play. The answer is because we live in a diverse world, and the stories
  we want to tell are not just about us. We cannot on one hand criticize players for wanting to play themselves, and
  then not want to tell as many stories and hear as many stories as we can.</p>
<p>All access gaming means welcoming people with new stories to our tables, and making those tables easily attended.
  Since accessibility isn’t the default, however, we have to begin designing our games around change, rather than
  expecting the change to develop around games.</p>
<h4 id="accessible-randomizers">Accessible Randomizers</h4>
<p>Dice are one of the most inaccessible accessories in our hobby—and yet they’re also one of the most integral. They’re
  difficult or impossible to read for those with vision problems, and those with tremors or other fine motor control
  issues may have difficulty rolling them.</p>
<p>The dice that are most readable for low vision or blind gamers are often clunky, large, and difficult to roll,
  especially for pool-based games where you need a lot of dice. Some people like to design braille dice, which is great
  for completely blind players, but braille readers and NLP (no light perception) blind people are a small fraction of
  the population. There’s lots of low vision folks out there who want good looking large print dice, or other options.
</p>
<p>This is part of why the <em>Fate Accessibility Toolkit</em> was written for the Fate system. Fate dice are easily
  read by touch and they’re more accessible than most dice because there isn’t any counting to be done. In the vast
  majority of Fate games, you never roll more than four dice, which are all the same size and shape.</p>
<p>In addition, if you don’t want to handle tactile dice (or if tactile dice aren’t an option for you), many dice apps
  have options for Fate or Fudge dice. There’s also the physical <a
    href="https://www.evilhat.com/home/deck-of-fate/">Deck of Fate from Evil Hat</a> and the Deck of Fate app. The Deck
  of Fate mimics the probability of Fate dice with the numeric results shown in large numbers—red for negative results,
  black for neutral, and blue for positive. The licensed Deck of Fate app from <a
    href="http://deckoffate.hiddenachievement.com/">Hidden Achievement</a> has an option to add a skill profile and let
  the app do all your math for you.</p>
<p>The Fate system is accessible, and it can be made more accessible by players and GMs.</p>
<h4 id="text-issues">Text Issues</h4>
<p>Rules embedded in a wall of small print. A multi-page character sheet full of columns of stats. Many games aren’t
  friendly to those who have trouble processing text.</p>
<p>Tactics like retaining white space on the page and including “cheat sheets” that summarize important rules in large
  print can help make a game book easier to read and reference. Different versions of the character sheet, including one
  that is decluttered and has plenty of room to write, can also make your game more accessible. Consider offering these
  as free downloads to make them available to anyone who needs them.</p>
<p>PDFs, which can be zoomed in to make the text easier to read, are becoming more widespread, but some of the most
  popular games aren’t yet available in PDF form. Nor are most gaming books available via audiobook, although ebooks can
  be turned into audiobooks, particularly if they are in .ePub or .mobi formats. (<em>Fate Core System</em> is available
  in both .ePub and .mobi formats in addition to PDF.)</p>
<h4 id="the-verbal-component">The Verbal Component</h4>
<p>In a hobby that is almost entirely about the spoken word, people who cannot hear or speak might be shut out. Those
  who struggle with sensory input or crowds can easily be overwhelmed by a noisy table and people talking over each
  other.</p>
<p>Deaf gamers face specific struggles within the hobby—or they don’t. If a Deaf gamer finds other Deaf people to game
  with, then they can game in their own language. But if they want to play new games and meet new people, it may seem
  like an overwhelming challenge. Disabled gamers can hack a game and tell stories within our own social groups and
  disability related communities, but it’s when we try to bridge the gap and play with able bodied players that things
  become more difficult.</p>
<p>A lot of this boils down to being aware of the needs of the gamers at your table. Ensuring that everyone has a chance
  to express themselves in whatever way they need to—whether spoken, signed, or written—can help gamers feel less
  isolated. If you see someone pulling back from group discussion, see if you can give them a chance to communicate
  without being spoken over. Take time to calm the overall atmosphere of the room when your players have gotten excited.
  There’s an understandable tendency to let things go as long as players seem engaged, but keep an eye out for the quiet
  ones and look for ways to make the table comfortable for them as well.</p>
<h4 id="conventions">Conventions</h4>
<p>Conventions are where game culture goes to develop. People take new tools back to their home FLGS (Friendly Local
  Game Store) or to their homebrew games. Cons help by creating standards of access and requiring able bodied
  participants to be aware of the access limitations which are present at the con, and how they can better support
  disabled places in their own environments.</p>
<p>Gaming will benefit from creating better representation by simply creating space at all conventions—not just the ones
  that disabled folks work at. Hire someone within your convention planning team to specifically work on accessibility.
</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions to get you started:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Since our hobby is so focused on vocal storytelling, we need to remember that not everyone can hear in a loud
    crowded gaming hall. Allocate space for games run by or played by d/Deaf gamers and others who need to play in a low
    distraction environment.</li>
  <li>Create a website for your game that can be easily accessed by visually impaired attendees, or offer the option of
    large print character sheets.</li>
  <li>Make wheelchair friendly lanes in hallways and the exhibitor hall, and put disability seating in panel spaces.
  </li>
  <li>Have a designated and well advertised quiet room with low lighting where attendees who are overwhelmed by the
    crowds, the sounds, the visuals, etc. can go to rest and recharge.</li>
</ul>
<p>What this all boils down to, whether it’s a blind player or a player on the autism spectrum, is that we must be in
  dialogue with one another, so that every single one of us can play.</p>
<h1 id="the-nitty-gritty-of-specific-disabilities">The Nitty Gritty of Specific Disabilities</h1>
<p>In this section we talk about a lot of different disabilities, how to play them, and what to look out for.</p>
<p>We’ve presented them in the most straightforward way—divided up and addressed one at a time. But the fact of the
  matter is, disabilities intersect; they don’t just intersect with each other (Elsa is deafblind, which means she’s
  both!), but they also intersect with other identities. Disabled people aren’t just disabled; they’re also PoC,
  cisgender, transgender, and as many intersections of identity as you can come up with.</p>
<p>When you’re working through this section and creating a character, you shouldn’t use this as a menu to say, “Oh cool,
  my character can have ALL these disabilities.” It should be approached as a tool for building disabled characters
  thoughtfully.</p>
<p>A few questions to guide you along the way:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How did my character acquire this disability?</li>
  <li>What kinds of adaptive devices does this character use? What have they used in the past that didn’t work for them?
  </li>
  <li>Is the condition complete (totally deaf, totally blind) or is it on a sliding scale?</li>
  <li>How does my character relate to their disability? How do they relate to people asking them questions about it?
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Despite media portraying most disability narratives as stories of tragic acquisition, whether it be a car accident or
  a random illness, not all disability narratives are like that. Some people are born with their disability, others
  experience a slow decline in their senses because of aging. The decision of how your character became disabled is just
  as important as what the disability is, because it will inform their entire history.</p>
<p>If you’re interacting with a disability that you’ve never thought about before, it’s probably worth doing the tiniest
  amount of research outside of this book to find out how people deal with diagnosis and adaptation; regardless of how
  your character got their disability, they will have ways of seeing the world that you have never thought of.</p>
<p>In each of these sections, we talk about how the disability manifests, how it could work mechanically in Fate Core,
  and how it might make itself known in play. Each section also gives tips on how to play a character with that
  disability, with suggestions on how to avoid tropes that are often considered offensive or problematic by people who
  live with those disabilities.</p>
<h2 id="navigating-the-dark-blindness">Navigating the Dark: Blindness</h2>
<p><em>Hi, Elsa here—I may have mentioned it before, but I’m blind. Specifically, I’m completely blind in one eye, and
    partially sighted in the other. I have used a white cane to navigate and I recently started working with a guide
    dog.</em></p>
<h3 id="living-with-blindness-and-low-vision">Living with Blindness and Low Vision</h3>
<p>Blindness is a disability frequently portrayed in media. Whether it’s a superhero like Daredevil, a victim like Reba
  McClane in <em>Red Dragon</em>, or a soccer player like Marina Datillo in <em>Arthur</em>, we see a lot of different
  blind people throughout our media.</p>
<p>What we don’t see are the variations of blindness that are the reality of the world. Ten percent of all blind people
  in the world are actually totally blind. For the rest of us (myself included) it’s a liminal space. Some of us are
  fully blind in one eye and legally blind in the other. Others have shades of grey, where the colors drain from the
  world they see. Yet others see through pinholes or toilet paper rolls, a telescope to the world that others see fully.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <h4 id="sidebar-legally-blind">Sidebar: Legally Blind</h4>
  <p><strong>Legally blind</strong> is a term used to define blindness under the law. Someone who is legally blind
    either has a visual acuity of a certain level (how sharp your vision is) or a field of vision of a certain level
    (can’t see peripherally.) People who are legally blind are restricted from the use of motor vehicles and might be
    eligible for disability benefits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blindness isn’t a static condition; when creating mechanics and fiction for gameplay, be specific about what your
  character does or doesn’t see. Can the character see out of one, both, or neither eyes? What does the character see
  out of the eyes that are sighted?</p>
<p>When you create a blind character, you need to work out for your character:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Depth perception:</strong> It helps you do a lot of things. See stairs, catch a baseball, gauge how large
    something is at a distance (turns out a spaniel on a hill can look a lot like a Great Dane if you’re not careful).
    It lets you know when to stop before you crash into a glass door, and is probably the key factor to driving a car or
    playing bumper cars. Characters without depth perception will struggle with several day-to-day tasks that you might
    not think of because they’re unable to see where something is in their world.</li>
  <li><strong>Color:</strong> When it comes to color and definition, do you see only in shadow, or do you see the world
    in colors? Are those colors dulled, or are they bright and shiny? Do people’s faces have definition, or are you
    seeing them as balls of fuzziness?</li>
  <li><strong>Field of vision/peripheral vision:</strong> These are almost the same thing. Field of vision is how much
    you see when looking straight ahead—can you see everything that’s in front of you or is it like looking through a
    tube? Peripheral vision is what you see out of the corners of your eyes. If you don’t have peripheral vision, you
    can only see what’s straight ahead of you—and depending on the cause of your blindness, that too might be
    compromised. Both of these things let you and other players know what you see. Can you see the entire desk that
    you’re sitting at or can you only see what’s right in front of you?</li>
</ul>
<p>The world can be as fuzzy as a 1950s-television set, or clear as day out of one eye. What it can’t be is magically
  enhanced for no reason. Playing a blind character only makes sense if you’re willing to invest your characterization
  in it. For example, people often argue that Daredevil isn’t really blind, because his powers allow him to “overcome”
  that disability without having sight. Basically, if his powers let him “see,” is he really blind? Depends on who you
  ask. Playing a character with blindness means acknowledging and playing out the effect it has on how they experience
  the world. If you don’t want to do that, then don’t play a blind character because then it’s just color. It’s fine not
  to reflect the blindness in your character’s stats—but if it’s just a disability for roleplay value, then it needs to
  be done carefully and respectfully.</p>
<h3 id="blindness-and-aspects">Blindness and Aspects</h3>
<p>Your aspects related to blindness will link to how blind your character is. Once you know the answers to the
  questions in the previous section, you’ll have a better idea of how to pick your aspects. They should illustrate the
  ways in which your character is disabled, and probably at least hint at how your character deals with that disability.
  And although you may pay more attention to sense like hearing or touch, blindness doesn’t give you supersenses to
  accommodate for the lack of vision.</p>
<p>Consider how situation aspects representing dim light or darkness affect your character. Here’s where the details of
  your character’s blindness are important—is she completely blind, or does she have limited vision? If she isn’t
  relying on sight at all, it makes sense that <strong>Poor Lighting</strong> can’t be invoked against her by opponents!
  On the other hand, if she’s hoping her limited vision gets the job done, <strong>Poor Lighting</strong> might
  dramatically affect her.</p>
<p>Some blindness-related aspects include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>One-Eyed Pirate</strong>. Invoke to: intimidate, bluster, sail, swashbuckle, etc. Compel to: miss a
    flanking attack, misjudge distance, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Thickest Glasses This Side of the Mississippi</strong>. Invoke to: keep a poker face, intimidate with a
    stern lecture, etc. Compel to: lose a trail in the rain, require concentration to follow a rapidly moving object,
    etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trouble aspects can be a bit more one-sided:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Can’t See in the Dark</strong>: Compel to complicate things during twilight, make nighttime navigation
    impossible, make a power failure that much more challenging</li>
  <li><strong>Peripheral Vision? What’s That?</strong>: Compel to make spotting that ambush harder, visually chaotic
    scenes that much more challenging</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of Depth Perception Makes Stairs My Worst Enemy</strong>: Compel to slow movement through a building
    or aboard a ship, fail to notice the curb, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="blindness-and-skills">Blindness and Skills</h3>
<p>One of the important things to remember when working with blind characters is to not assume incompetence. Mr. Magoo
  and his stats are not what we’re going for, because that uses disability for comedy. This is Fate and we’re going for
  highly competent blind people. People who know how to use their adaptive devices. So perhaps your character has a low
  skill when it comes to observation, but their sense of observation when they use their cane is different. Flexibility
  in how you perceive the capabilities of blind people will help you here.</p>
<h3 id="blindness-and-stunts">Blindness and Stunts</h3>
<p>Unlike aspects, which work in both positive and negative ways, stunts are always in your character’s favor. Think
  about ways in which a character’s blindness could become an advantage in specific circumstances.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the example below, maybe we’d want to have Elsa’s directional sense in relationship to her blindness represented
    as a stunt instead of an aspect. She could have the high concept <strong>Blind Jewel Thief</strong> and the stunt
    Directional Sense Tied to Memory, Not Sight:</p>
  <p><strong>Directional Sense Tied to Memory, Not Sight (Notice):</strong> Because Elsa is blind and her sense of
    direction is tied to memory, not sight, she gets +2 to overcome or create advantage actions using Notice when
    maintaining her orientation in poorly lit conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="blindness-and-conditions">Blindness and Conditions</h3>
<p>Consider taking the conditions Without My Device (page XX) and Low On Charge (page XX).</p>
<h3 id="player-advice">Player Advice</h3>
<p>So your character is blind. Let’s just use me as an example; it’s easier that way. If it’s part of the character’s
  high concept, your description might look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Blind Jewel Thief</strong>: Despite being a world-class jewel thief with several daring heists to her name,
    Elsa is completely blind in one eye and partially sighted in the other, with no depth perception. Invoke to: Plan a
    theft, evaluate security measures, estimate a jewel’s value, move in complete darkness, etc. Compel to: Be
    recognized by a former associate, lure with a jewel too tempting to resist, miss fine-print information, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But maybe blindness is not central to your concept and it’s part of your character’s other stats instead. For
  example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You’re trying to break into a dark warehouse to steal a jewel. Great, but what can you do in the dark? With the
    stunt Directional Sense Tied to Memory, Not Sight, Elsa knows how to quickly escape the building when the cops
    arrive, because rather than relying on her eyesight, she’s relying on her mental map of the warehouse.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="gm-advice">GM Advice</h3>
<p>Compelling blindness ultimately depends on the kind of blindness that your player has chosen to give their character.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Back to Elsa and the jewel heist in the warehouse. Let’s say Elsa didn’t manage to run fast enough, and she has to
    hide out. If her trouble is <strong>Peripheral Vision? What’s That?</strong> it could be invoked against her in this
    situation because the cops can come at her when she’s not looking.</p>
  <p>Uh oh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The trick here is to always use it with empathy—you’ll see this a lot in this book. It’s not about Mr. Magoo and
  making blind jokes; it’s about portraying disabilities that are real. So, a blind character <em>might</em> fall down
  some stairs, but if they do, it won’t be for comedic purpose. Your goal here is not to use the disability because it’s
  funny.</p>
<h3 id="antagonists-with-blindness">Antagonists with Blindness</h3>
<p>You know the White Walkers in <em>Game of Thrones</em>? The zombies of <em>The Walking Dead</em>? The witches
  in…almost everything? Most of them have cataracted sclera. It’s pretty exhausting to have to share an eye or eyes with
  every evil protagonist or chorus on the planet. Remember that blindness isn’t an indicator of personality or of moral
  alignment.</p>
<p>It’s also not an indicator of powers—not all people who can see ghosts should be blind, not all psychic characters
  should be blind. Not all blind characters should be able to subvert their blindness using superpowers (or at all).</p>
<p>While these aren’t necessarily antagonist approaches, they might be, and it’s best to avoid these tropes.</p>
<h2 id="negotiating-the-sound-barrier-d-deaf-hard-of-hearing-characters">Negotiating the Sound Barrier: D/deaf &amp;
  Hard of Hearing Characters</h2>
<p><em>Here’s Elsa again. I’m deaf and I use a hearing aid.</em></p>
<h3 id="living-with-d-deafness-and-being-hard-of-hearing">Living with D/deafness and Being Hard of Hearing</h3>
<p>Deafness is another disability that lies within the world of liminal spaces. When you play a deaf character, you
  should recognize that there are varying degrees of deafness in the same way that there are varying degrees of
  blindness. People can be deaf in one ear or both, and deafness and hearing loss can be on a scale from mild to
  moderate to profound to severe. You can have varying levels of deafness within the context of one person, too. For
  example, a player could have a character who has only mild deafness in one ear, and profound deafness in the other.
</p>
<p>What complicates this, ultimately, is that while a blind character might read braille instead of a text based medium,
  a Deaf character uses a variety of methods to communicate, and they might participate in a culture that is not hearing
  culture.</p>
<p>Does a Deaf character sign instead of speak? Do they have a Deaf speech pattern? Do they wear a hearing aid, or do
  they eschew them because they choose not to participate in hearing culture? (And you’re probably wondering, what _is_
  hearing culture anyway? Check the sidebar on page XX.)</p>
<p>All these questions are important and valid, and they are where the D/deaf distinction comes in. People who identify
  as Deaf with a big D are members not just of the Deaf community by their disability, but by their cultural identity.
  Depicting this in an RPG setting might be a challenge, but it’s a storytelling challenge that can make your
  backgrounds richer.</p>
<p>Playing a deaf character doesn’t mean that you need to use a deaf speech pattern. In fact, you shouldn’t do that
  unless if you’re D/deaf and you have one already. Those speech patterns have been mocked and belittled by comedians
  and dramatists for over a century; there’s no need to repeat them in the present.</p>
<p>To play a deaf character you need to figure out some of the specifics around the disability. How deaf is your
  character? Has the character been deaf since birth, or is deafness a new part of their life?</p>
<p>Those choices affect how the character communicates and where they fit in the spectrum of D/deaf culture. Among the
  most important questions you’ll need to answer are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does your character reject D/deaf culture as a whole, or do they embrace it?</li>
  <li>Are they happy with their identity as a Deaf person, or are they ambivalent about it because of how it has changed
    their life?</li>
</ul>
<p>Deciding how your character communicates with the other characters in the game is the next most important decision
  you make. Whether you communicate through vocal language, a whiteboard, sign language, and/or lip reading, this
  decision always affects your gameplay.</p>
<p>Players shouldn’t try to create new ways for people with disabilities to live their lives, because there’s so much
  richness in the disabled community to look at and learn from. This especially applies to Deaf culture and language. If
  you’re in a game played by only able bodied people, your responsibility is to never mock or create your own “sign
  language.” Doing so is like mocking another language to entertain yourselves—you wouldn’t do it with Spanish, don’t do
  it here. American Sign Language, British Sign Language, and other forms of sign are not to be co-opted. If you want to
  learn how to sign, then do so and do it with respect, engaging with the culture and history of Deafness as you do so;
  learning to sign also makes you more able to work with a larger community of people in the world you live in.</p>
<p>There are games that have successfully developed hand signals for various kinds of communication. The third edition
  of <em>Ars Magica</em> is an excellent example of this. The creators of <em>Ars Magica</em> developed signs and hand
  gestures that correspond to spells you can cast at the table. This makes the game accessible to deaf players and able
  bodied players alike. This is an acceptable hack because it creates words for a system which doesn’t exist, rather
  than creating language where there is already a language in place to be used and learned. If you’re just making your
  own sign language words up because you don’t feel like looking up the word for <em>dragon</em>, it’s very different
  from creating a language of magic. Though of course, witches and wizards can be D/deaf too!</p>
<blockquote>
  <h4 id="sidebar-hearing-culture">Sidebar: Hearing Culture</h4>
  <p>Hearing culture is what it says on the tin. It’s the expectation that the gold standard for living is to be able to
    hear. Deaf people have a completely different set of cultural norms and expectations, and hearing culture assumes
    that all norms for hearing people should be the preferred standard. Oral speech instead of sign is prized. It’s the
    false assumption that all things must be heard. Hearing culture is often enforced by not allowing Deaf people to
    sign, forcing people to accept hearing aids, and many other tactics to enforce the supremacy of hearing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <h4 id="sidebar-deaf-culture-and-sign-language">Sidebar: Deaf Culture and Sign Language</h4>
  <p>If you’re playing a character who’s part of the Deaf community, make sure you do your research, and make sure you
    respectfully portray that disability and the people who have it. As long as you’re doing that, consider that you
    might actually be able to get a stunt or a new way to invoke an aspect from being part of such a tight-knit
    community. Deaf culture comes in many forms, including attending schools for the Deaf or the use of sign language.
  </p>
  <p>Historically, the development of sign language has differed significantly from country to country. Japanese Sign
    Language, for example, is still mostly a colloquial language, while American Sign Language is something you can
    learn from YouTube videos and community college courses. And knowing American Sign Language doesn’t mean you can
    communicate with a Deaf person from England unless you also know British Sign Language.</p>
  <p>Deaf culture isn’t limited merely to linguistic preferences, however. There are also medical preferences around the
    choice of whether or not to treat deafness and hearing loss at all. For some parts of the community, there is a
    resistance to invasive medical technology, particularly cochlear implants, especially when it comes to children.
    Hearing parents of deaf children are often criticized for forcing their children to participate in hearing culture
    before they have the chance to learn about Deaf culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="deafness-and-aspects">Deafness and Aspects</h3>
<p>For able bodied and hearing players, it might seem very foreign and exclusionary to not want to hear, or to not want
  hearing people to participate in your culture, as some Deaf advocates feel. Being deaf often means that you are
  excluded from the hearing world. So Deaf culture being inaccessible to the hearing makes a certain amount of sense.
  That doesn’t mean that the world we’ve got already in place doesn’t use the lack of sound to various advantages. What
  you do with it in game matters a lot.</p>
<p>As an example for where silence (and lack of sound) can matter in a game, let’s talk about the action genre. Action
  adventures use the silent communication techniques we’ve seen in movies—they’re not sign language, but they’re still
  usable by characters of all abilities. A sniper who receives all their signals through hand gestures from a distance
  may be a <strong>Silent Killer</strong>, and so on.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Silent Killer</strong>: Invoke to get a bonus on stealth, take the perfect shot. Compel to miss the sound
    of an approaching enemy.</li>
  <li><strong>Perfect Lip Reading</strong>: Invoke to visually eavesdrop or communicate silently. Compel to miss part of
    a message when the speaker looks away.</li>
  <li><strong>One Side Hears, One Side Doesn’t</strong>: Invoke to ignore the effects of a flash-bang grenade. Compel to
    not know which side danger is approaching from.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are plenty of ways to play a deaf character who interacts with their world with ease and engagement, without
  ever making them someone they’re not. You don’t ever have to make the character’s arc about them hearing or not
  hearing, but instead about how they navigate through the world. The purpose here isn’t to make deafness the plot
  point, but rather to make deafness part of the character as a fully realized piece to their identity.</p>
<h3 id="deafness-and-skills">Deafness and Skills</h3>
<p>This mostly concerns talking and hearing skills. That doesn’t necessarily meant that your character can’t hear, but
  you might want to consider how it affects things. For example, Elsa’s deaf knight can’t hear the Master at Arms when
  he yells at her. Her deaf jewel thief can’t hear the clicks of a safe being opened.</p>
<p>But, she may have ways around it. Sign language, good social skills which get people to help her out on the sly,
  keenly trained touch sense for picking locks. Rather than think about what your character can’t do, consider how
  deafness affects what she can.</p>
<h3 id="deafness-and-stunts">Deafness and Stunts</h3>
<p>Think of particular circumstances in which being D/deaf is a benefit. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ignore the Noise:</strong> Because I am Deaf, I can ignore noise around me. Opponents cannot invoke
    aspects against me related to chaotic or distracting noise.</li>
  <li><strong>Pillar of the Deaf Community (Rapport):</strong> Because of my many friends and contacts in the Deaf
    community, once per game session I can find a helpful NPC who provides me a bit of useful information, lends me some
    gear, or lets me lay low in their apartment for a few hours. Work with the GM to decide on an appropriate person.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deafness-and-conditions">Deafness and Conditions</h3>
<p>Consider taking the conditions Without My Device (page XX) and Low On Charge (page XX).</p>
<h3 id="player-advice">Player Advice</h3>
<p>D/deafness invokes will have a lot to do with how your character deals with their D/deafness.</p>
<p>So, for example, Elsa has a hearing aid, and another character is <em>really irritating</em>. This NPC will Not Shut
  Up, and they’re just going on and on, mansplaining to her about how to break into a museum, when she’s worked plenty
  of heists… <strong>Cyberpunk Hearing Aid</strong> lets her tune out the frequency of the NPC and thus, she doesn’t
  have to fight him and waste time.</p>
<p>Another good example: If Joss Whedon had written a D/deaf character in <em>Buffy</em>, in the episode “Hush”, where
  everyone’s voices are taken away, the aspect <strong>Fluent in ASL</strong> would have been useful in communicating
  with the rest of the Scooby Squad.</p>
<h3 id="gm-advice">GM Advice</h3>
<p>Switching genres (because we can), let’s talk about how to compel D/deafness. Elsa’s playing a Knight of the Realm,
  which is great for her. But hearing aids don’t exist in this setting, so her character doesn’t hear very well at all
  out of one ear. So when the Master at Arms shouts at her to “Halt!” the GM can invoke <strong>Deaf Knight of the
    Realm</strong> and Elsa will be in a fair amount of trouble. After all, not following orders is not a good trait in
  someone meant to be a champion for the Queen.</p>
<h3 id="antagonists-with-deafness">Antagonists with Deafness</h3>
<p>There have been some really fantastic antagonists in film and television who are Deaf. If you want to consider going
  that route, two examples to look at are from the first season of <em>Fargo</em> the TV show, and <em>John Wick 2</em>.
  Generally speaking, you don’t want to imply with the deafness aspect that the character cannot communicate or speak,
  so either they should have an interpreter for sign, or they can lipread or speak just fine.</p>
<h2 id="betrayed-by-the-meatcage-mobility-issues">Betrayed by the Meatcage: Mobility Issues</h2>
<p><em>Elsa here. I don’t have a mobility issue, but I consulted several of my colleagues and friends who do.</em></p>
<h3 id="living-with-a-mobility-impairment">Living with a Mobility Impairment</h3>
<p>When you choose to play a character with mobility related disabilities, begin with asking how mobile—rather than
  immobile—your character is.</p>
<p>As with deafness and blindness there’s—you guessed it—a sliding scale of mobility. Players may create a character
  with a limp, a character with low balance who uses arm crutches, or a character who is either para or quadriplegic.
</p>
<p>These choices determine how your character moves around the world, but also how your character interacts with the
  world. Counters are almost always too tall for a non-powered wheelchair user; a stairwell is almost always a challenge
  for a crutch user. When playing a character with a mobility disability, the thing to consider is what your environment
  bans you from doing. Whether it’s successfully navigating a staircase during a chase scene or finding your wallet on a
  tall counter, your environment is often your biggest enemy.</p>
<p>In the case of mobility impairment, we’re also not talking about a single diagnosis in quite the same way that we are
  with D/deafness or blindness; we’re talking about a whole host of diagnoses, some of which might come with other
  disabilities in tow.</p>
<p>For example, a character with muscular dystrophy has a whole body experience with their mobility issues, whereas
  someone who lost a limb due to an accident or an infection won’t have the same physical experience. Before you pick
  the mobility impairment your character lives with, you should definitely do research to understand where the mobility
  impairment comes from and how it will affect play.</p>
<p>Furthermore, not every disability uses the adaptive devices in the exact same way. In this case, I’m talking
  specifically about wheelchairs. You see “funny” memes on the internet a lot about miracles around wheelchairs, an
  image of someone standing up out of a wheelchair to reach a bottle of booze, for example.</p>
<p>Not only is that offensive, but it’s also downright incorrect. Wheelchair users aren’t just people who cannot walk or
  stand; many wheelchair users are given chairs because of fatigue or stress being put on their bodies. A wheelchair
  user might, for example, be able to stand up out of the chair and walk a few feet, or reach for a book on a tall
  shelf, but they may not be able to walk for more than a block, or run. It always comes down to what the wheelchair is
  meant for—and that’s why there’s so many kinds of wheelchairs to choose from. For more details on types of wheelchairs
  and how to add mechanics to your game, see page XX.</p>
<h3 id="mobility-disabilities-and-aspects">Mobility Disabilities and Aspects</h3>
<p>Your aspects should reflect the kind of mobility impairment, as well as how it might interact with living in the
  wider world.</p>
<p>Aspects for mobility impaired characters might include things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cane-Wielding Martial Artist</strong>: Invoke to gain a bonus to attacks and defense, or to not be parted
    from your weapon. Compel to give you trouble with that unexpected drop or to fail to notice the archer atop the roof
    across the street.</li>
  <li><strong>The Steve McQueen of Wheelchair Drivers</strong>: Invoke to speed away from the guards, to dodge through
    pedestrian traffic, or get a bonus to modifying your wheels for a soft surface. Compel to put a staircase in your
    way.</li>
  <li><strong>Weak Hands in the Cold</strong>: Compel to make it hard to hold onto the roof of the train going through
    the Canadian Rockies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mobility-disabilities-and-skills">Mobility Disabilities and Skills</h3>
<p>A mobility related disability doesn’t mean that characters can’t participate in combat, or escapes, or high-speed
  chases; it just means acknowledging during gameplay that your world is from the waist down, or requires an extra set
  of limbs to be ascended. See page XX for vehicle rules for wheelchairs.</p>
<p><em>Mobility issues</em> primarily refer to issues with legs or with the ability to stand. However, characters might
  also have issues with their hands or arms. Generally in those cases the source of the issue is from pain, but muscles
  can atrophy or be injured and hands can develop tremors. If your character’s mobility impairment is at the spine, or
  involves arm issues, then obviously that will present differently.</p>
<h3 id="mobility-disabilities-and-stunts">Mobility Disabilities and Stunts</h3>
<p>Many of the stunts relating to mobility disabilities may be tied to the use of assistive devices. In that case, GMs
  should be mindful that loss of the device in the fiction means taking away stunts from the player character. It may be
  okay in certain circumstances but should be a rare event. Other non-mobility-impaired player characters placed in
  similar circumstances (e.g., captured by a villain, lost in the desert, etc.) should suffer equivalent losses.</p>
<p>Examples of mobility-related stunts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Blade Runner (Athletics):</strong> Because I have blade-style prostheses, I can run like the wind and jump
    like a hare; I get +2 to overcome actions made with Athletics when running speed or jumping height or distance are
    important.</li>
  <li><strong>Powered Wheelchair (Drive):</strong> Because I use a powered wheelchair, I get +2 to overcome or create
    advantage actions made with Drive against opponents on foot in appropriate terrain.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mobility-disabilities-and-conditions">Mobility Disabilities and Conditions</h3>
<p>Consider taking the conditions Without My Device (page XX), Exhausted (page XX), Making Payments (page XX), Hacked
  (page XX), Low On Charge (page XX), Limited Focus (page XX), and Medical Debt (page XX).</p>
<h3 id="player-advice">Player Advice</h3>
<p>Look for ways that your disabilities may open up options, rather than limit them. Let’s take inspiration from a real
  world example: Senator Tammy Duckworth.</p>
<p>You’re running a <em>House of Cards</em> inspired Fate game, and there’s a sit-in on the Senate Floor. Sen. Duckworth
  has you covered. Her aspect <strong>Prosthetic Leg</strong> allows her to say that she hid her cell phone inside of
  the prosthetic; she’s smuggled it onto the floor of the Senate so she can record everything that happens during the
  closed session.</p>
<p>(This actually happened. Senator Duckworth is amazing.)</p>
<h3 id="gm-advice">GM Advice</h3>
<p>Compels might refer to not having the right adaptive device for a situation. It’s a lot harder to run in a regular
  prosthetic than with blades, for example. If you’re not in a cyberpunk setting, you probably don’t have a mechanized
  limb with fully articulated fingers. One kind of wheelchair might be better than another; for example a motorized
  scooter can only move so fast, whereas a manual wheelchair can be propelled by arms and possibly feet, or pushed by
  another person.</p>
<p>So Cara has multiple wheelchairs. She and her <em>Leverage</em>-style gang of heisters have managed to track their
  bad guy down to the seaside, and using an all-terrain air tire wheelchair, she can race along the sand dunes with the
  rest of her crew.</p>
<p>But when she’s trying to sneak into the bank owned by a notorious murderer, she uses a motorized chair, for quiet,
  less noticeable thieving. Both of these wheelchairs are effective modes of transit, both can be compelled, both can be
  invoked.</p>
<p>Both the GM and the player need to know the wheelchairs, and what they can do, though!</p>
<p>A prosthetic limb is not easy to use, and it takes time and practice to expertly handle one. Has your character had
  that limb for a long time, or is it new to them? What is the learning curve for them at this stage of their life?
  Also, is it a good prosthetic or is it a crappy one? There’s lots of kinds of prosthetics and they aren’t always good.
</p>
<p>Missing limbs and paralyzed body parts aren’t the only kind of mobility impairment that your characters can
  experience, either. Disorders like cerebral palsy have different levels of effect on people’s lives. Some are crutch
  or cane users while others require a wheelchair or scooter to make their way through the world. Doing a little bit of
  research to get your character into the right place for the story you want to tell can go a long way.</p>
<p>Like with everything else in these sections, knowing what the disability is caused by is important, but knowing how
  it manifests and the sliding scale on which it functions is far more important. Your character doesn’t have to look
  like Stephen Hawking or like Artie from <em>Glee</em> in order to qualify as someone with a mobility impairment.</p>
<h3 id="antagonists-with-mobility-disabilities">Antagonists with Mobility Disabilities</h3>
<p>There’s a great character in <em>Kingsman</em> who has blade feet and she’s an assassin. That being said,
  wheelchairs, canes, and so forth are often used by evil characters to make them look vulnerable somehow. Let’s use
  Richard III as an example: within the Shakespeare play it’s assumed that Richard is ugly and deformed because he’s a
  bad person. We should strive not to make players with mobility related disabilities feel as though the alignment of
  the character is reliant upon their physical description.</p>
<h2 id="little-people-big-game-dwarfism">Little People, Big Game: Dwarfism</h2>
<p><em>Now I’d like you to meet Casey, who has a form of Dwarfism.</em></p>
<h3 id="living-with-dwarfism">Living with Dwarfism</h3>
<p>The concept of a dwarf in a fantasy setting was made popular by J.R.R. Tolkien, who was inspired by the dwarves from
  Norse and Germanic folklore. In most game settings, dwarves as a race are short with a solid, stocky build, many times
  shown with a beard (depending on the setting, dwarven women may also have beards as in Tolkien’s conception). They are
  known in many systems to be hardy, resistant to magic and poison, able to see in the dark, and attuned with various
  mining and smithing tasks. Some settings include subraces of dwarves with different abilities, aptitudes, appearances,
  and cultures. Settings with more of a modern, science fiction, or urban fantasy spin might have a similar version of
  dwarves, but as a player it’s important to think about the difference between the near-human dwarf based in fantasy
  and the actual impairment that people, like me, have lived with throughout history. No matter which type of dwarf you
  end up playing, there are some important things to think about when your character has unusually short stature.</p>
<p>Before describing types of dwarfism and things to think about when roleplaying someone with dwarfism, it’s important
  to note language use. “Midget” was once used to describe a person with proportional dwarfism, but is considered an
  offensive term because of its origins in the freakshows of the late 1800s and early 1900s. This connection is
  important because dwarves on the freak show circuit were on display solely as a curiosity based on their short
  stature. If you want to refer to a character with a form of dwarfism, good word choices include little person, dwarf,
  or person with short stature (or even better, their name!).</p>
<p>Dwarves are a great example of what disability scholars and activists refer to as the social model of disability.
  When a dwarf in a fantasy setting is in a dwarf-centric area, everything is sized for the average dwarf. Think of
  Gandalf visiting Bilbo Baggins in the Shire; everything in the Shire is sized for people with a stature shorter than
  the average human, making Gandalf the one disabled by the environment by being too tall!</p>
<p>When someone lives in an environment that’s built so they can function in the best way for their body, many pieces of
  that person’s environment may become unusable for other people with very different bodies. For example, I’m the only
  person with dwarfism in my family and everyone on my dad’s side of the family is over six feet tall (roughly 1.8m)
  with several people around six and a half feet tall (2m). My grandmother’s house was specifically built for taller
  than average people and made me feel like I was a gnome doing dishes in an orc’s house!</p>
<p>For players who want to play a character or have an NPC with dwarfism (versus a dwarf as per the fantasy race), it’s
  important to research what form of dwarfism the character has as each form comes with its own challenges in life.</p>
<p>I’ll give a really brief glimpse at the two main types, although there are more than 200 different types and all of
  them result in an adult height that is less than 4’10” (unless the person has had medical intervention to make them
  taller). The two types fall under <strong>proportionate dwarfism</strong> (with all parts of the body being similarly
  proportioned to a typically growing human. Ben Woolf, who played Meep on <em>American Horror Story: Freakshow</em> had
  this type) or <strong>disproportionate dwarfism</strong> (with limb-to-torso proportions different, either average
  torso and short limbs or short torso with long limbs. Peter Dinklage, the actor playing Tyrion Lannister in <em>Game
    of Thrones</em>, is a good example). Most forms are genetic, especially disproportionate types, but can be from
  birth defects or even acquired from something like brittle bones restricting someone’s growth. Each type brings its
  own challenges, some medical and some from social and structural barriers, all of which should be considered when
  trying to choose your high concept and trouble.</p>
<p>For example, with achondroplasia, the most common type of dwarfism where a person’s arms and legs are much shorter in
  relation to the trunk of their body, your character would likely stop growing between 3’8” and 4’9” (with a male
  averaging around 4’3” and a female around 4’1”). For most people with achondroplasia, their lifespans aren’t impacted
  at all so you won’t be tailoring a trouble based on that. That being said, the character might have problems with
  their joints due to the way their bodies move and are structured, so that might lead to a trouble based on needing a
  lot of medical care or physical therapy—<strong>Medical Bills Make Me Broke</strong>, <strong>In Debt to Corrupt
    Medical System</strong>, or <strong>Requires Long-Term &amp; Frequent Medical Care</strong>.</p>
<p>Another example is the type of dwarfism I have, called pituitary dwarfism. It’s the most common type of proportionate
  dwarfism and can come about for a variety of reasons, like genetics, a brain tumor, or a pituitary gland injury (the
  pituitary is a gland in the brain that produces hormones that control growth and other important bodily functions). If
  the character is like me, they might have been born with it because of a broken blood vessel or they may have started
  out growing typically and had a brain tumor as a kid that impacted that area of the brain. Since I was born in the
  late 20th century in a developed country with modern medicine, I had growth hormone injections as a teenager to help
  me get taller. Nowadays, when kids are identified early as having pituitary dwarfism, they start the injections as
  early as possible, depending on their family’s health insurance and financial resources since the medication is
  expensive. An adult character may find that they need to continue these injections as well as deal with other health
  issues, making good troubles very similar to the character with achondroplasia—although there may be additional issues
  related to hard-to-get medications that are also hard-to-afford and can make <em>Breaking Bad</em> feel less
  fictional!</p>
<p>Something else to consider is that my type of dwarfism, when I’m not replacing growth hormone as well as the other
  hormones my body doesn’t make on its own, makes me have less physical endurance and get tired easily, which makes life
  difficult for adventuring or trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic setting.</p>
<h3 id="dwarfism-and-aspects">Dwarfism and Aspects</h3>
<p>There are other things that could make for good troubles or even just minor disadvantages or quirks for a variety of
  characters who are unusually short, whether they have a form of dwarfism or are a race that’s just smaller than a
  human. These might include: <strong>The World Is the Wrong Size</strong>, <strong>Picked on About Size by
    Peers/Family/Rivals</strong>, <strong>Hard to Find Clothes/Equipment/Weapons That Fit Body/Limbs</strong>, or the
  character might have a troubled or problematic relationship with a person, group, or institution (the only doctor that
  treats your character’s impairment, a fight the character started at the local Little People of America meeting, or
  inability to get healthcare from the government because of some snafu).</p>
<p>It can also be interesting to tie your trouble in with your high concept. For example, I’m a fitness geek who likes
  to try out all sorts of physical activities, so I might roll up a <strong>Dwarf Martial Artist</strong> as a high
  concept with a trouble relating to <strong>Having Trouble Finding Gear in My Size</strong>. A friend of mine rolled up
  a character with my type of dwarfism to play a <strong>Dwarf Spaceship Pirate</strong> who is <strong>Constantly Upset
    About Being Underestimated Because of her Size</strong>.</p>
<ul>

<h3 id="dwarfism-and-stunts">Dwarfism and Stunts</h3>
<p>Stunts related to dwarfism might have to do with the ability to hide in small spaces, or taking advantage of being
  socially less noticed, For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hard to Spot (Stealth):</strong> Because I am a Small Person, I get +2 to Stealth when hiding in
    restricted spaces.</li>
  <li><strong>Fly on the Wall (Empathy):</strong> Because I am often socially overlooked, I get +2 to overcome or create
    advantages with Empathy when observing people in a group as long as I do nothing to attract attention to myself.

<p>Invoking being a Little Person might be a challenge, but you’re sure to find options. For example, a rogue might use
  their size to sneak and hide underneath things that average sized people may not be able to use. Or, they might blend
  in with a crowd better because they can’t be spotted at the eye level of where everyone else is.</p>

<p>Compels may show up in social situations. <strong>Constantly Upset about Being Underestimated Because of Her

  they have a short fuse.</p>
<p>Compels may also occur in terms of negotiating a world not built for the character’s body. So, Casey may have to find
  unique solutions around opening some kinds of doors, accessing countertops, ovens, or even security systems.</p>

<p>Tropes aren’t cool. So try to avoid having Little People represented only as uh, Little People. Like leprechauns. Or

<p>Check out Tyrion Lannister as a great example of a Little Person who isn’t necessarily evil—or good, either.</p>
<h2 id="chronic-illness-as-disability">Chronic Illness as Disability</h2>
<p><em>This is Elsa again. I have a heart condition, and I consulted a wide range of individuals dealing with chronic
    illnesses when writing this section.</em></p>
<h3 id="living-with-chronic-illness">Living with Chronic Illness</h3>
<p>This is a sticky issue. We have to start there, because not everyone with a chronic illness, or illness at all, would
  consider themselves disabled. Some people would.</p>
<p>We’re also treading close to the curable realm, which is another sticky issue for disabled people. Some people with
  disabilities (like myself, Elsa) don’t feel they need a cure. They don’t want someone to come in and say, fix their
  eyesight permanently, for many reasons. But with chronic illness, sometimes there are cures available. Sometimes there
  are not.</p>
<p>Certainly, under the header of chronic illness, we also have to touch briefly on terminal illness, or severe illness
  which might leave the character with a disability that’s mentioned elsewhere in the book.</p>
<p>Advising caution here is paramount. Playing a character with multiple sclerosis (MS), cancer, or other
  life-threatening illnesses isn’t a good idea unless if everyone at the table is okay with it, and if you’ve done the
  research to make sure that you can do it responsibly.</p>
<p>With all of that said, let’s address some of the basics:</p>
<p>If your character has a chronic illness, it will pervade their entire life. They will not make a single decision
  without thinking about how their decision affects them with their chronic illness. A character with Crohn’s disease
  isn’t going to eat anything—certainly not the bread offered with bread and salt, nor a tasty snack offered by a
  fairy—without knowing whether or not the contents will harm them. If it’s a life or death decision, they will have to
  weigh that against their health. We’re counting asthma and allergies as part of chronic illness, because it’s a
  chronic interaction with the body, persistent, ever present, and something you have to be constantly aware of.</p>
<p>An excellent example of a character with a chronic debilitating illness is President Bartlet from <em>The West
    Wing</em>. President Bartlet’s relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis challenges him to perform his duties as
  president as expected. We often see him doing things like dropping things or shaking hands until he absolutely cannot
  do it anymore; he even goes so far as to hide his condition because he feels he can’t be President and be a patient at
  the same time.</p>
<p>These are the expectations we need to weigh when living with chronic illness. It’s true with any disability really,
  but especially when it comes to something that is treatable, and that you have to live with the consequences of the
  minute you do just about anything.</p>
<p>A character with Osteogenesis Imperfecta might behave like Miles Vorkosigan does—recklessly. But they will pay for it
  every time, with casts, with new treatments, with painful medical care.</p>
<p>Ultimately, how your character handles their chronic illness will determine how the chronic illness affects them. A
  character with a pain disorder probably won’t display anything externally to suggest that they are disabled. Invisible
  disabilities might be the easiest to roleplay because they come out through roleplaying someone’s lived experience. A
  character who is in constant pain might have checks to make sure they can focus, or may have a short fuse when trying
  to be patient. A character with pain might also be able to take a lot of hits in combat, because they’re used to
  feeling pain—they may not recognize being smacked with a sword in the same way that someone else would. There’s an
  inversion here, both with pain and with fatigue. Whereas most of these disabilities affect your character in the
  moment, pain and fatigue might only show up during downtime scenes. Your character might thrive on the adrenaline,
  only to find when they come down, they’re not able to function as well.</p>
<h3 id="chronic-illness-and-aspects">Chronic Illness and Aspects</h3>
<p>When selecting your aspects for a chronically ill character, consider the various symptoms that accompany the
  diagnosis when you build them. Research is key, as always.</p>
<p>For example, President Bartlet might have a trouble aspect like <strong>Suddenly Heavy Objects</strong> as a symptom
  of his MS—he might drop something suddenly, or collapse.</p>
<p>Fitting these aspects together is something like a puzzle. Whatever comes up most frequently for the illness might be
  what you pick, but knowing how it comes into play will be more important. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fibromyalgia Makes My Skin Hurt</strong>: Compel to make recovering from the Exhausted condition that much
    harder or to distract while you’re trying to concentrate.</li>
  <li><strong>Bones Like Glass, Pain Tolerance Like Steel</strong>: Invoke to ease recovery from conditions and
    consequences related to pain and fatigue. Compel to aggravate damage taken by a blunt force attack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sample aspects for characters with pain conditions might include a <strong>Part Time Wheelie</strong> researcher who
  can’t stand for long periods of time without ill effects, or a thief who has burned off their fingerprints so many
  times that they <strong>Don’t Have Feeling in Their Fingertips</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="chronic-illness-and-skills">Chronic Illness and Skills</h3>
<p>Skills will vary from illness to illness. One might have no issue with running, but another might not be able to use
  Athletics at all. Weighing these differences is important, but again this is about vigilance in the setting of your
  disability.</p>
<h3 id="chronic-illness-and-stunts">Chronic Illness and Stunts</h3>
<p>You won’t find much here that’s advantageous, but with a bit of creativity you might find something, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lay Medic (Lore):</strong> I’ve spent so much time in hospitals that I have more medical information that
    a lot of medical residents. I gain +2 to overcome and create advantage actions using Lore when it comes to hospital
    procedure, medical knowledge, and health insurance bureaucracy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chronic-illness-and-conditions">Chronic Illness and Conditions</h3>
<p>Consider taking the conditions Exhausted (page XX) and Medical Debt (page XX).</p>
<h3 id="player-advice">Player Advice</h3>
<p>Invokes for a chronic illness will be challenging. There’s little that’s good about a chronic illness, few advantages
  that you can eke out of what’s generally a disruptive illness. But you might be able to use it to your advantage.</p>
<p>Someone who has a habit of fainting, for example, might be very good at faking it so that they can be hauled into the
  giant asylum for their undercover work.</p>
<h3 id="gm-advice">GM Advice</h3>
<p>Compelling an illness is easy. You could compel President Bartlet to drop a pitcher given to him by the Queen of
  England in her presence, and have that cause tension during a political negotiation.</p>
<p>You could have a character suffer fatigue during a chase, or have another develop blurry vision during a car driving
  scene. Negotiating these compels requires time with your player to figure out what their character’s disease would do
  to them.</p>
<h3 id="antagonists-with-chronic-illness">Antagonists with Chronic Illness</h3>
<p>One thing not to do is to make the weakness for your villain their illness. You shouldn’t get to the baddie just as
  they hack up their lungs from consumption, and find that they’re already dead. They shouldn’t be a supervillain with a
  cough, or a mastermind with cancer. These are tropes that have been trod a lot, and all they do is reinforce that
  being sick in the body means that you are sick morally.</p>
<p>Basically, disability and illness is not a barometer for morality. Watch for this in your NPC building; it’s a common
  trope that many people fall into without noticing.</p>
<blockquote>
  <h4 id="sidebar-modeling-an-asthma-or-allergy-attack">Sidebar: Modeling an Asthma or Allergy Attack</h4>
  <p>This is an option for dramatic, climactic moments that directly involve a character’s chronic illness, not a recipe
    for every compel of the related aspect.</p>
  <p>Simply speaking, this is a conflict. Give the asthma or allergy attack a skill and a rating, like Good (+3) Asthma
    Attack or Great (+4) Peanut Allergy. Give it stress boxes based on its rating: one box per point of rating (so a +4
    Peanut Allergy would have 4 stress boxes). These stress boxes escalate in value just like a PC’s, but an asthma or
    allergy attack can check off as many stress boxes as it wants to absorb a hit, and has no consequences.</p>
  <p>When you’re running the conflict, the asthma or allergy attack uses its skill to attack its victim each exchange,
    dealing physical stress. The victim might defend with Physique, Will, Athletics, or something similar. Using a skill
    that makes sense, the victim can attack the asthma or allergy attack on their turn, dealing stress to it. For
    example, an inhaler or epi pen might be a Resources or Lore roll, while using breathing techniques might be Will or
    Athletics. Other people can help by creating advantages, but can’t directly attack the asthma or allergy attack
    unless they have sufficient justification (such as a doctor administering treatment).</p>
  <p>When the asthma or allergy attack gets taken out, it ends, leaving the victim with whatever stress and consequences
    it’s inflicted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="not-your-puzzle-autism">Not Your Puzzle: Autism</h2>
<p><em>I’d like you to meet Zeph, Laurel, and Jess. They’re autistic and have written a fantastic section on how autism
    (a form of neurodiversity) works!</em></p>
<h3 id="living-with-autism">Living with Autism</h3>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by difficulty with social interaction and communication as well as by
  restricted or repetitive behavior or interests. ASD casts a very broad net and includes many variations and more
  specific traits that aren’t at all uniform and may be difficult to recognize (Asperger’s syndrome has been removed
  from the most-recent psychiatric manual and is now classified as part of ASD). It can be especially difficult to
  recognize ASD because popular media featuring autistic characters tends to focus on a narrow set of traits that are
  easy to recognize and has led to a stereotyped ideal of what autism means and how it looks.</p>
<p>Think of autistic characters you have seen in television and movies and make a mental list of “autistic” traits you’d
  expect based on these depictions. I expect your list might include things like “difficulty understanding emotion,”
  “socially inept,” “logic-minded,” “obsessive,” or “inflexible.” I suppose all of those could be used to describe me,
  but they don’t really get at what it’s like for me, the underlying causes of behavior that makes people think of me
  that way. As a result, often when I see autistic characters in the media, I feel that they’re actually playing a
  neurotypical person with exaggerated quirks. I rarely feel that I’m seeing myself represented.</p>
<p>Despite what you see in many movies and TV shows, savant syndrome (genius in a particular area) is very rare;
  portrayals of it run the risk of implying autistic people are valuable only if they have superpowers despite their
  neurology, so I recommend not using this trope or being very careful with it. Exercise care when playing, and consider
  your character as happening to have both high intelligence and autism, not some magical combination.</p>
<p>When playing an autistic character, I recommend throwing out those ideas of how you think autism looks and focusing
  instead on how your character feels. Obviously autism is not the only thing that affects your character’s experience
  of the world, but it does mean that much of what they experience is processed differently.</p>
<p>For example, one of the more common autistic traits rarely seen in media depictions is sensory processing
  difficulties. Many autistic people are either hypersensitive or hyposensitive to sensory input—textures, sounds,
  images, light, etc. Your character might become overwhelmed by sensory input and shut down or appear to tune out, or
  they might engage with a point of focus, such as touching a wall as they walk along to keep them grounded in an
  overwhelming situation. Sensitivity isn’t always bad. I may enjoy the feel of my hand along the brick wall or have a
  whole-body experience of the sound of an orchestra. Your character may appear oblivious to others while experiencing
  hyper-awareness of some aspect of their surroundings.</p>
<p>Another common autistic trait is typically referred to as “special interests.” All this means is that we may be
  interested in things that seem unusual to others or may express those interests in ways that seem unusual. It might be
  that the interest is more typical for someone much older or younger than we are (maybe a cartoon or type of toy), that
  it’s focused on things that are mostly seen as practical or necessary rather than fun (such as collecting mundane
  objects and knowing tiny or obscure details about them), or that the topic of interest is typical but the level of
  interest seems intense and obsessive to others (such as listening to the same song over and over for weeks, which also
  happens to be a sensory experience). These may change over time, or an autistic person may rotate through a restricted
  list of special interests.</p>
<p>Similarly, autistic people often feel most comfortable when following structured routines and may have rituals which
  help them orientate in the world. I’ve prepared my breakfast in the same order, from the same ingredients, every day
  for over a decade years now. Having that disrupted no longer causes the meltdowns it did when I was younger and had
  fewer coping mechanisms, but it’s distressing enough that I bring the ingredients with me when I travel.</p>
<p>When considering the kind of autistic character you intend to play, consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Which sensory experiences does my character find most painful? Which do they find most pleasurable? Do they hardly
    experience some? You might have a love-hate relationship with your sense of touch. Or the two needn’t overlap:
    perhaps your light sensitivity means you’re most comfortable in dark rooms analyzing background noise on a headset.
    Although the lived sensory experience of an autistic person can be complex and overwhelming, focusing on a few
    sensory areas may help you and the GM remember when your character would respond to a stimulus.</li>
  <li>What are my character’s most common methods for coping with sensory imbalance? Some possibilities for handling
    everyday sensory issues might include fidget toys, chewable jewelry, or earplugs. If the character is non-verbal,
    they might use a word/picture board or electronic device to communicate. See <em>Adaptive Devices</em> (page XX) for
    more suggestions and for advice on using game mechanics to reflect your character’s coping mechanisms.</li>
  <li>What routines can’t my character miss and/or what rituals keep them grounded?</li>
  <li>What have some of my character’s previous special interests been? You may want to declare these in the moment, but
    understanding whether your character is more likely to collect objects or happens to know every line and inflection
    of their favorite films will shape the type of special interests you may have in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="autism-and-aspects">Autism and Aspects</h3>
<p>Answering the questions above will help you shape what kinds of aspects your character might have. If you have
  auditory hyper-awareness, whether positive or negative, you might often hear things which others around you only
  perceive as background noise. This could be an aspect called <strong>Can’t You Hear That?</strong>. As a benefit to
  your character, it could be invoked to let them notice some tiny detail in the environment that alerts the group to
  danger or reveals something important. On the other side, it could be invoked against the character by distracting
  them from the task at hand, such as a car alarm going off three blocks away.</p>
<p>If the character is in a particularly chaotic environment or one with a very intense element such as bright lights or
  loud noises, the environment would have an aspect relating to the sensory effect. An environment with the aspect
  <strong>Noise From All Directions</strong> is likely to have a negative effect on the character. Or, your character
  might turn it around, creating a temporary aspect like <strong>In the Zone</strong>. They’ve filtered out extraneous
  stimuli completely and can focus exclusively on a single goal or sound as an anchor, giving them an advantage to
  accomplishing that specific thing.</p>
<p>An environmental aspect <strong>Stimtastic Wonderland</strong> would mean a room is full of fun textures that the
  autistic character finds calming or interesting. Stimming is a behavior used to provide sensory input. It may be used
  to filter out more distracting input, as a calming sensation in anxious situations, or just because it feels good.
  Some examples include spinning, fidgeting, tapping fingers, hair twirling, and whistling. A room with velvety
  curtains, textured walls, and toys that make odd noises could be a lot of fun to explore! (<em>Velvet is my sensory
    nightmare! —Laurel</em>) It could be invoked as a benefit to your character by helping them to calm down and focus,
  or invoked against them by making them not want to leave the room or focus on anything else until they’re satisfied.
  (<em>Or cause them to freak out! This is a great example of how autistic people’s sensory experiences may dramatically
    vary. —Laurel</em>)</p>
<p>Your current special interests may also be a source of aspects. For example, your character might have the
  <strong>World’s Best Key Collection</strong>. The character would find keys incredibly fascinating, have a collection
  of keys, and maybe own lock-picking equipment. It’s important to note that this isn’t a professional interest
  (although they may also pursue an occupation that utilizes or relates to it); the knowledge isn’t simply practical but
  rather borne out of the same sort of love that most people have for their favorite book or TV show. They would be able
  (and happy!) to talk to you for hours about different manufacturers and style characteristics, historical details, and
  how they work.</p>
<p>This could be invoked by letting them have the right type of key or equipment to get into a locked door, or knowing
  enough about the lock to realize that they’d noticed the key earlier and can find it. For a compel, while other
  characters are involved in something more immediately and obviously relevant like questioning an NPC or trying to
  solve a puzzle, the character may get caught up in the idea that if only they can discover the key, they can handle
  the situation. They become fixated on finding a key or interrupt a successful interrogation by demanding the key’s
  whereabouts.</p>
<h3 id="autism-and-skills">Autism and Skills</h3>
<p>Autistic characters aren’t necessarily more or less skilled in any particular areas than any other character.
  Consider how your answers to the questions in “Living With Autism” may affect your character’s skills, either
  inherently or through practice. For example, your character may not take any points in Notice because she often finds
  herself visually and auditorily overwhelmed in large spaces. Or she may have coped with that by developing excellent
  Notice to sort through too much information to focus on what’s necessary. Similarly, autistic people don’t necessarily
  have poor people skills. Your character may have put effort into easily building Rapport or learning how to Deceive by
  imagining their statement as true.</p>
<h3 id="autism-and-stunts">Autism and Stunts</h3>
<p>This is a place where special interests shine. A character with an intense interest in mythology could have a stunt
  related to it, like:</p>
<p><strong>Ask Me About Folktales! (Lore):</strong> Gain +2 to overcome and create advantage actions made with Lore
  regarding folktales, folklore, fairy tales, and related subjects.</p>
<h3 id="autism-and-conditions">Autism and Conditions</h3>
<p>Consider taking the conditions Without My Device (page XX) and Meltdown (page XX).</p>
<h3 id="player-advice">Player Advice</h3>
<p>The most important piece of advice for playing autistic characters is to play a character rather than a disability.
  Every autistic person is different, and all of us are much more than this particular diagnosis. It’s a large part of
  how I experience the world, but it isn’t my whole life. When designing an autistic character, don’t only consider how
  they’re different but how they have to adjust to function in a world built for people who think differently from them.
  Personally, I probably wouldn’t start with more than 2 aspects and 1 stunt that specifically relate to autism,
  preferring to focus on other parts of a character’s personality and making sure that they are well-rounded and
  interesting with the same range of motivations I would give any other character.</p>
<h3 id="gm-advice">GM Advice</h3>
<p>Let your player’s answers to the questions in “Living with Autism” shape how you use it in gameplay. Consider where
  they may encounter challenges and talk with them beforehand about specific consequences. For example, if things go
  poorly, they may be affected by a condition and experience a Meltdown (page XX). While some autistic people are
  completely non-verbal and must use other means of communication, others who can talk under normal circumstances might
  struggle to do so or lose the ability to speak under severe stress.</p>
<h3 id="antagonists-with-autism">Antagonists with Autism</h3>
<p>Because antagonists are often more one-note than a player character, exercise particular care in avoiding
  stereotypes. As previously mentioned, the savant trope has been done to death. Nor is lack of empathy an autistic
  characteristic. If an antagonist seeks or accepts humanity’s demise, this isn’t because they’re autistic.</p>
<p>Try not to make their disability into their undoing either. If Laurel’s your antagonist, you can’t just wrap her in a
  velvet blanket and call it a day—unless perhaps you’ve done intensive backstory research which has identified this
  critical vulnerability. Consider instead that reactions to stimuli and special interests may make your antagonist an
  interesting and well-rounded person, just as they do your character.</p>
<h2 id="depression-generalized-anxiety">Depression &amp; Generalized Anxiety</h2>
<p><em>This section is a group effort—many people on this project wrestle with depression and/or anxiety, so we all
    contributed a bit.</em></p>
<h3 id="living-with-depression-or-anxiety-disorders">Living with Depression or Anxiety Disorders</h3>
<p>Both sadness and anxiety are feelings that are normal and even healthy. However, for many people at some point in
  their lives, these feelings become pervasive and excessive, interfering with daily life. Anxiety and depression are
  separate diagnoses, but they often overlap and coexist, so we’re covering them together.</p>
<p>Your character’s way of presenting as depressed or anxious may be completely counter to the way that they operate
  normally. A calm scientist or researcher may shoot off in rage when they’re anxious, for example, and many individuals
  wrestling with depression have an outwardly cheerful demeanor.</p>
<h4 id="depression">Depression</h4>
<p>Characters with depression fall into two categories: People who have always had depression because of their brain
  chemistry and people whose depression is triggered by an event. The latter can come with relationships to other
  disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder, but for now we’re just talking about garden variety depression.</p>
<p>Depression isn’t a long period of sadness. Its symptoms reach much farther than that. The American Psychiatric
  Association’s criteria for diagnosis—sleeping too much or too little, lack of interest in activities, misplaced or
  excessive guilt or regret, overeating or losing appetite, fatigue, trouble concentrating and making decisions, slower
  than usual movement, thoughts of death and suicide—gives those who don’t live with depression a better idea of how it
  manifests, without using language that might stigmatize the person who has it. That being said, it’s not the be-all
  and end-all of depression diagnosis and shouldn’t be used as a checklist. Only five of the criteria must be present
  for a diagnosis of depression, and suicidal ideation is not a requirement. The way the symptoms manifest may vary
  wildly from person to person.</p>
<p>A character with depression loses interest in doing things they want to do—but it’s important not to play a depressed
  character like a mopey dog. Depressed characters may feel like they’re drowning in sadness, but that won’t necessarily
  change how they speak. It won’t make them sound like a sad puppy, which is one of the most common mistakes I see in
  playing depressed characters.</p>
<p>What’s more, depression is complicated—it doesn’t always manifest as sadness or despair. Often it’s a stubborn
  malaise, a general lack of motivation to do anything, that people frequently mistake for sheer laziness. Sometimes
  it’s hopelessness, sometimes angry self-loathing, sometimes all of the above. However it manifests, many depressed
  people have well-rehearsed social coping mechanisms—be careful of being <em>too</em> self-deprecating, say “I’m great!
  How are you?” a lot, practice that cheerfulness and enthusiasm. Fake it ‘til you make it.</p>
<p>Another thing to note about playing a character with depression is that depression can spiral. You start out feeling
  sort of not okay, and by the end of the depression spiral you’re at the bottom of your well. You have no idea how to
  get up or out, except to dig yourself further into the darkness.</p>
<p>Many people with depression also wrestle with anxiety, which compounds this problem—you obsessively worry about
  things, can’t find the motivation to actually do something, then feel guilt and self-loathing about the whole thing.
  It’s a feedback loop from hell.</p>
<h4 id="anxiety-disorders">Anxiety Disorders</h4>
<p>Anxiety disorders cover a large range of issues centered on fear (fight or flight in the moment) and anxiety (worry
  about future incidents, often resulting in avoidance). These are natural and necessary feelings, so to be a disorder
  they must be out of proportion for the situation and/or hinder your ability to function in some way. Anxiety often
  interacts and coexists with other kinds of mental illnesses.</p>
<p>It’s worth doing a cursory search for anxiety disorders to look at the different types and get a sense of the many
  ways they can manifest. Phobias, panic disorders, agoraphobia, separation and social anxiety all fall under this
  umbrella. For the purpose of this book, we focus on generalized anxiety disorder, which is primarily persistent and
  excessive worry that disrupts your daily life. Symptoms include restlessness or nervousness, fatigue, insomnia,
  nightmares, muscle tension and pain, digestive issues, and trouble concentrating. Part of what makes generalized
  anxiety so difficult to diagnose is that the worries often focus on things that people normally worry about, like your
  job, money, the health of your family and you, the state of the world, or everyday things like chores and
  appointments. Everyone worries about those things, but it’s a disorder when that worry is excessive and interferes
  with your daily life.</p>
<p>The American Psychiatric Association only recognizes <em>panic attacks</em>, rather than the more general <em>anxiety
    attacks</em>. But in practice, most professionals and certainly most people who suffer from anxiety recognize that
  not all attacks result in panic. Personally, my anxiety attacks often happen in crowded grocery stores and similar
  situations. It takes a lot of effort to keep moving through the crowd, and I feel very nervous. However, the worst
  case scenario is that I might leave a loaded grocery cart behind and walk out of the store, and so far I haven’t had
  it get even that bad. I don’t feel like I’m panicking. But I still feel smacked upside the head by my anxiety.</p>
<p>An anxiety attack can present itself in a number of different ways. It can feel like energy you can’t push away, or
  push down; it can present like rage, hot and fast and uncontrolled; or it can present as completely shutting down and
  being unable to do anything. There are lots of different ways to have anxiety, just as there are lots of different
  ways to be deaf or blind.</p>
<h3 id="depression-anxiety-and-aspects">Depression, Anxiety, and Aspects</h3>
<p>A Miskatonic University librarian has situational depression about <strong>So Much Knowledge Forever
    Forgotten</strong> after their library is destroyed. They dwell on their grief over books and information lost to
  time—but also know a lot of obscure facts in an effort to save and reconstruct what they can.</p>
<p>The mobster with Seasonal Affective Disorder has the aspect <strong>Winter Is Coming</strong> and needs a certain
  amount of self care to manage their needs during wintertime game settings. But if you need to know when the sun will
  set or rise, or when the days start getting longer again, or you need access to a sun lamp, they’ve got you covered.
</p>
<p>The action scientist’s anxiety may manifest as fear of failure with an aspect like <strong>I’m Probably a
    Fraud</strong>. It’s easy to see how to compel this, but it could also be invoked when the scientist has thoroughly
  researched a topic in an attempt to feel like they can look like an expert, or when they need to deceive someone—after
  all, they spend all of their time deceiving people about their qualifications, don’t they?</p>
<p>Social anxiety can manifest as thoughts like <strong>I’m Pretty Sure They Secretly Hate Me</strong>. It will make
  social situations daunting, but may also give your character an advantage in seeing through people who are trying to

<p>It’s unlikely that depression or anxiety would manifest in changing your skills. They may however, make it more
  difficult to do things. Characters may struggle with the actual action of getting up and doing research, or leaving
  for a heist. They may have to overcome debilitating anxiety, which raises the difficulty of using a skill, or fight
  off a panic attack after doing so (or as a consequence of failing a roll). It’s challenging to find skills that would
  be affected, however, because this is much more of a roleplaying disability than a skill based one.</p>
<h3 id="depression-anxiety-and-stunts">Depression, Anxiety, and Stunts</h3>
<p>You might think there’s not a lot of advantage you can draw from depression and anxiety, but… well, yeah, you’d be
  right. But if you think laterally, you can come up with a thing or two.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Self-Deprecating Joker (Rapport):</strong> Maybe it’s a shield—you make the joke before they do—but you’ve
    become skilled at the delicate art of the self-deprecating joke. Gain +2 to create advantage and overcome actions
    using Rapport when you crack wise at your own expense.</li>
  <li><strong>I’ve Heard It Before (Empathy):</strong> There’s nothing anyone else can say about you that your own
    internal monologue hasn’t said to you a thousand times already. Gain +2 to Empathy defense actions against mental
    attack or create advantage actions made to belittle, insult, or anger you.</li>
  <li><strong>Overstocked Emergency Kit (Lore, Crafts):</strong> Sometimes your planning for the worst case scenario
    pays off. You gain +2 to overcome actions made with Lore or Crafts when your emergency kit comes in handy—first aid
    supplies, signaling devices, battery chargers, protein bars, tools, etc.</li>

<h3 id="player-advice">Player Advice</h3>
<p>Just like other disabilities, it’s important to become familiar with the mental illness you’re portraying. Jot down a
  description and seriously consider each portion of the diagnostic material your character faces—it might be helpful to
  look at <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/"><em>medlineplus.gov</em></a> or another trusted online database. While the
  American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-V is helpful, it’s a tool primarily used by doctors; a layperson’s guide to
  mental illness will serve you just as well, if not better.</p>
<p>Commit to your choices, and follow through even when it’s difficult in gameplay.</p>
<h3 id="gm-advice">GM Advice</h3>
<p>Compels should never be about dictating to a player how their character should feel or react; this is even truer for
  aspects relating to mental illness. If you want to move a compel towards an emotional state, bring it about through
  negotiation with the player. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>GM to a player: “Chris just lost the file that would prove Dr. Akhan’s innocence. Given their <strong>Major
      Depressive Disorder</strong>, do you think this would cause them to experience feelings of worthlessness or
    guilt?” (Holds up a shiny fate point…) “If so, what happens next?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GMs can also rely on narrating physical symptoms that the character would experience. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>GM: “That night, Chris is unable to sleep. They toss and turn, but their mind won’t stop coming up with ways things
    could go wrong. By morning, Chris feels like there isn’t enough coffee in the world.” (Holds up a fate point.) “How
    does that affect them?”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="antagonists-with-depression-or-anxiety">Antagonists with Depression or Anxiety</h3>
<p>So, when it comes to antagonists with depression or anxiety, you’ve got lots of examples to go with, but consider
  this when writing your antagonists or NPCs:</p>
<p>Is that character just like Sadness from <em>Inside Out</em>? Are they a mere representation of their diagnosis, or
  are they something more? Like with the rest of these disabilities and mental illnesses, a character who has a
  diagnosis isn’t <em>only</em> their diagnosis. They’re more than that. They’re a whole character, a whole person.</p>
<h2 id="am-i-dreaming-schizophrenia">Am I Dreaming: Schizophrenia</h2>
<p><em>Here’s Lillian, to talk about a perpetually misunderstood mental illness: schizophrenia.</em></p>
<h3 id="living-with-schizophrenia">Living with Schizophrenia</h3>
<p>Schizophrenia is a disease that affects how you interpret reality. For someone without it, laughing off a sudden
  paranoid thought or an image out of the corner of your eye isn’t hard. When you’re schizophrenic, either of these
  situations can be fraught with fear.</p>
<p>It’s much more than hearing voices.</p>
<p>Schizophrenics have a brain disorder that can impact their ability to socialize and/or interpret reality, and are
  often “read” as having depression instead of schizophrenia. They are not inherently dangerous or psychopathic serial
  killers.</p>
<p>There are <em>positive symptoms</em> of schizophrenia, meaning new symptoms and behaviors that weren’t present in
  someone before the onset of their schizophrenia. There are also <em>negative symptoms</em>, meaning behaviors and
  abilities that have ceased or been greatly suppressed by schizophrenia.</p>
<p>The most famous of positive symptoms is hearing voices. It’s not a symptom every schizophrenic has, and the voice(s)
  can vary wildly in what they’re like. Some research suggests that the voices vary based on cultural differences, and
  American schizophrenics hear voice(s) that are critical, paranoid, and cruel. These voice(s) are famous in the news as
  directing schizophrenics to commit crimes. In reality, they most often chip away at the confidence and coping
  abilities of a schizophrenic.</p>
<p>Many schizophrenics tend to isolate themselves at home, cut off social contact, and avoid others whenever possible.
  This is often an outgrowth of their paranoia, another famous positive symptom. Severe anxiety and fears surrounding
  personal safety contribute greatly to this isolation. It also tends to prolong schizophrenic episodes. Delusions,
  strange behaviors, anxiety, hallucinations, nervousness, difficulty with coherent speech, and confusion are all common
  positive symptoms as well.</p>
<p>When it comes to the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, these losses are not only painful for a schizophrenic to
  cope with, but can be emotionally wrenching for those around them. Some schizophrenics exhibit a <em>flat affect</em>,
  meaning they no longer show signs of any personality; this often comes hand in hand with social withdrawal and severe
  fatigue.</p>
<p>These two sides of schizophrenic symptoms can make it hard to spot schizophrenia and complicates getting a correct
  diagnosis—the positive symptoms look like a manic episode, while the negative symptoms look like depression.</p>
<p>Children are rarely diagnosed with schizophrenia. It’s also rare for onset to occur after age 45. In teens, the onset
  may look like normal teen behavior—sleeping issues, drop in grades, withdrawal, irritability. It’s unusual for a teen
  to hear voices, but it’s common for teen schizophrenics to experience visual hallucinations. Most people experience
  the onset of their schizophrenia in their twenties.</p>
<p>The onset of schizophrenia occurs through stages. <em>Promodromal</em> is a common entry point, characterized by
  sleep disturbances, irritability, exhaustion, and emotional outbursts. This phase can last for as short a time as a
  week, to months or even years. After this, people move into an <em>acute</em> stage. Most frequently, this is only a
  month or two, characterized by hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and difficulty thinking and speaking coherently.
  Most schizophrenics are diagnosed in the acute stage. Acute stage schizophrenia can lead to a <em>psychotic
    episode</em>. No longer able to distinguish between reality and delusions, bizarre behaviors and extremes of emotion
  can emerge. There are a number of schizophrenics who only experience a single psychotic episode over the course of
  their lives. It’s important to stress that during the acute phase, a schizophrenic can still—though often with
  difficulty—distinguish between their symptoms and reality. Psychosis is when they lose that grasp on reality.</p>
<p>As a schizophrenic is treated for their acute symptoms, generally through a triangle of antipsychotic medication,
  therapy, and social support, they slide into <em>remission</em>. Typically, symptoms subside during this time.</p>
<p><em>Relapse</em> is the final stage. The process repeats itself. But now there’s a frame already in place of care
  providers, people in a schizophrenic’s life who know about their condition, and a regimen of medication. This cycle
  may repeat several times before a longstanding remission occurs. A unique set of conditions may emerge over time,
  giving a schizophrenic an idea of what kinds of stresses and situations may cause a cycle of schizophrenic symptoms to
  return. As the years go by, positive symptoms may even decrease in severity, while negative symptoms increase and
  intensify.</p>
<p>A significant number of schizophrenics experience an <em>incomplete recovery</em>—they don’t respond to the most
  effective medications for schizophrenia, which acts as a substantial barrier to their long term recovery. These are
  patients who are willing and able to comply, but the medication simply fails to alleviate their symptoms. Often
  increasing social support and therapy has to take the place of medication. Most commonly, people experience negative
  symptoms in the case of incomplete recovery.</p>
<p>By now, you can see how perceptions of schizophrenia in media and entertainment don’t match the reality. It’s a
  complicated condition, one that leads people to an often solitary, stigmatized, and emotionally wrenching experience.
</p>
<h3 id="schizophrenia-and-aspects">Schizophrenia and Aspects</h3>
<p>Example aspects to convey your character’s schizophrenia could include:</p>
<p>Since you are a <strong>Creature of Habit</strong> to help order your thoughts, routine is very important to you.
  This aspect can be compelled to disrupt your routine and make the challenges you face more difficult. It can be
  invoked when you grab onto a routine and use it to pull some order out of the chaos in your mind.</p>
<p>Since your character <strong>Has Met the Bogeyman</strong> in the form of hallucinations, voices, or other
  manifestations of their fears, outside threats may not seem as immediate to you. This aspect can be compelled to make
  danger seem less menacing than than it is (”Just another hallucination, shut up, I know you’re not real!”) or on the
  contrary to make it reinforce one of your own familiar fears. It can be invoked when you use your experience with
  facing your demons to push past the fear of an immediate threat.</p>
<p>Since you’re <strong>Aloof for Your Own Damn Reasons</strong>, you don’t easily make casual connections with people
  you meet. This aspect can be compelled to make it difficult for you to befriend, convince, or sweet-talk NPCs. It can
  be invoked to resist peer pressure, seduction, attempts at getting information from you, and so forth.</p>
<h3 id="schizophrenia-and-skills">Schizophrenia and Skills</h3>
<p>Depending on the type and phase of schizophrenia your character has, anything that involves paying attention, short
  term memory, putting memories in order, and completing a task could be difficult to nearly impossible to accomplish.
  This is the burden of negative symptoms—behaviors and capabilities a schizophrenic can have impaired (or be unable to
  access/express). This could affect skills like Notice, Investigation, or Will when your character’s schizophrenia
  isn’t being managed well.</p>
<p>With positive symptoms (behaviors and capabilities schizophrenics experience that aren’t normal for them between
  schizophrenic episodes), they may believe they have supernatural abilities, they may suffer from feelings of paranoia
  and persecution, or they might exhibit risk taking behavior. Someone could experience elaborate delusions that they
  have skills they don’t have any real knowledge of. This could also affect Empathy and Rapport if people seem more
  dangerous than they are.</p>
<h3 id="schizophrenia-and-stunts">Schizophrenia and Stunts</h3>
<p>Stunts are a place where the experiences and coping mechanisms of characters with schizophrenia can shine. For many
  with schizophrenia, cognitive tasks are difficult. But when those tasks are accomplished with the methods and aids
  that work for a given person with schizophrenia, they’re no longer as difficult. Stunts can be used to accomplish
  things with a skill that under normal circumstances can’t be done; for characters with schizophrenia, you could write
  stunts that help them do what they can’t under general conditions, something they’re capable of in specific
  circumstances.</p>
<p>Consider stunts that represent those coping mechanisms by allowing you to perform certain actions with alternate
  skills, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>I Run Therefore I Am (Athletics):</strong> You’re an avid runner, and lean on the endurance and strength
    that builds to bolster your sometimes shaky mental resilience. Use your Athletics skill rather than Will to size
    your mental stress track.</li>
  <li><strong>Talk Them Up (Rapport):</strong> You’re aware that unhealthy paranoia is a thing you tend toward, so you
    consciously rely on the vibe you get chatting with people to determine their trustworthiness. Use Rapport rather
    than Empathy to defend against lies and deception.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="schizophrenia-and-conditions">Schizophrenia and Conditions</h3>
<p>There’s no condition for a psychotic episode. There’s no good way to capture the entirety of what a psychotic episode
  does to a person in game rules—it should only occur when you, the player, are OK with it occurring. Treat it as a
  self-compel of the aspect that establishes your schizophrenia, and play it out from there.</p>
<h3 id="player-advice">Player Advice</h3>
<p>Think about the times you’ve misread social situations every time your character has to socialize. You can be
  “perfectly normal” and misconstrue a statement as hurtful or threatening; having this brain disorder makes this easier
  to do. All the time.</p>
<p>Consider when and why (and if) your character can fake being okay, and how much it takes out of them.</p>
<p>Before playing a schizophrenic character, ask yourself these questions and jot down some notes. Knowing these things
  about your character will help you roleplay more conscientiously.</p>
<ul>
  <li>When did your character experience the onset of their schizophrenia?</li>
  <li>What kind of symptoms did they have then, and which ones do they exhibit now, if any?</li>
  <li>Are they in remission? In another stage?</li>
  <li>If they’re on medication, how well do they respond? Are they experiencing an incomplete recovery? Have they
    stopped taking their medication, now or in the past?</li>
  <li>Have they ever experienced a psychotic episode?</li>
  <li>What do they do to cope with their symptoms? How do they treat positive symptoms?</li>
  <li>What kind of treatment have they/do they receive?</li>
  <li>Who in their life knows about their diagnosis? If they keep it a secret, is it from everyone, or just specific
    people? What motivates their secrecy?</li>
  <li>How do they feel about their schizophrenia? Did they decide not to abuse alcohol or drugs to improve their chances
    at recovery, or do they abuse substances to “manage” their symptoms?</li>
  <li>Do they avoid personal relationships of any kind, or do they pursue friendships and romantic relationships like
    they would without their condition? Have they decided not to have children out of fear of possibly “passing it on”?
  </li>
  <li>How do the people in their life treat them, if they know their diagnosis? Are there strained personal
    relationships, or ones that were terminated when their schizophrenia began? Is anyone overbearing about it,
    constantly checking up on them regardless of how they’re doing?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gm-advice">GM Advice</h3>
<p>If your party contains a schizophrenic character, make sure you understand what schizophrenia is—and, just as
  importantly, what it is not. Avoid the tropes of violent psychopathy, multiple personalities, or whatever other
  nonsense popular culture has asserted it to be (including the word “schizo”—if that’s still in your vocabulary at all,
  consider excising it entirely, and not just at the game table). Give the player space to explore their character’s
  limitations. Don’t force a complete psychotic episode on them if they don’t want to play that.</p>
<p>That said, if they choose to play a schizophrenic character, give them the experience they want. Don’t be afraid to
  compel their disability-establishing aspect and make them feel the symptoms—voices, paranoia, etc. But make sure you
  do so from a place of knowledge, not pop culture. Yes, this means doing some homework as part of your own prep, but
  you signed up for that when you decided to sensitively run a game with disabled characters.</p>
<h3 id="antagonists-with-schizophrenia">Antagonists with Schizophrenia</h3>
<p>Age, treatment, social support, and country inform what these NPCs will be like. Schizophrenics in Western countries
  tend to report voices that are critical and cruel, while anthropological studies suggest auditory hallucinations
  experienced by schizophrenics in India and Ghana are far less geared towards devastation; these voices have been
  reported to be playful, even mild in their temperament. Most men become ill between 16-25, with 18 as an average age
  of onset. Women typically fall between 25-34, with 29 as an average age of onset. Where’s your NPC from? When did they
  experience their first episode? Have they ever been treated? Have any support, from anyone? When did they experience
  their first episode? Is it right now? Did they recover completely from their first episode? Or have they experienced
  incomplete recovery?</p>
<p>In general, you don’t look at someone and say “I bet they have schizophrenia.” Do they have visible symptoms, and if
  so, do they let other people call their own conclusions? When you have an NPC with schizophrenia, consider what (if
  anything) their schizophrenia looks like to the outside world, and how the outside world looks to them. If negative
  symptoms have impaired their ability to read social cues, they may be quiet, requiring coaxing. Or they may be a brash
  jerk. Schizophrenia impairs how the brain functions, so how they cope may be the most visible thing about their
  schizophrenia. If they experienced multiple episodes that created long term social and career issues for them, they
  may be willing to give a PC a break no one else would. Or they may hold them to a strict high standard, because they
  weren’t coping with what this NPC has had to live with.</p>
<p>So, your three beats to hit as you consider making a NPC with schizophrenia are how they look to others, how others
  look to them, and how they experience their schizophrenia.</p>
<h2 id="touched-by-fire-bipolarity">Touched by Fire: Bipolarity</h2>
<p><em>This is Phil; he’s been diagnosed with Type II Bipolar Disorder for a few years and is going to give you a sense
    of how that functions.</em></p>
<h3 id="living-with-bipolar-disorder">Living with Bipolar Disorder</h3>
<p>Bipolar disorder is a neurological condition commonly found in writers, artists, and industry leaders. While there’s
  a clear genetic link to the condition, it usually manifests itself in early adulthood. In my case, I suffered several
  depressions after the age of 25 and was diagnosed at 35. The condition is characterized by cyclical mood swings
  ranging from high-energy manic phases to severe depressions, and it’s considered easily treatable with a combination
  of medications, healthy lifestyle choices, and psychotherapy.</p>
<p>In my day to day life, my condition manifests itself in larger-than-life emotions. I get really happy, excited, and
  loud in a second and then I can get super moody and non-responsive as I mull over that one thing someone said to me
  three hours ago. I can be a hard act to follow.</p>
<p>Fiction and real life are rife with examples of bipolar characters, many of which met tragic ends. Winston Churchill,
  Marilyn Monroe, Russell Brand, and Carrie Fisher are well known examples from real life. Norman Osborn (The Green
  Goblin from Spiderman), Carrie Mattison (<em>Homeland</em> TV series), and Locke Lamora (The Gentlemen Bastards book
  trilogy by Scott Lynch) are textbook examples of fictional bipolar characters. In fact, The Gentlemen Bastards trilogy
  would probably be among the best models for bipolar characters; it captures the essence of bipolarity without getting
  stuck in over-realistic details that could hinder play.</p>
<p>What truly defines bipolarity is the existence of recurring, intense phases of manic activity, usually triggered by a
  series of strong stimulations brought by exciting or overwhelming experiences. When that happens to me, I feel like a
  rock star, I need less sleep, I’m easily distracted, I express excessive happiness, I get super irritable, I may feel
  restless, I experience racing thoughts, and I have a tendency to make too many plans. Trust me, these are like
  freaking roller coaster rides!</p>
<p>The disorder is divided into two categories, Type I and Type II. They mostly differ with how individuals experience
  mania. Type I individuals suffer a more severe form of mania that disrupts the ability to work and socialize, and may
  require hospitalization to prevent harm to themselves or others. They can lose touch with reality to the point of
  being psychotic.</p>
<p>As someone with Type II, I go through milder phases of mania (called hypomania), which remain rooted in reality. In
  fact, given the modern world’s expectations for high performance, people with Type II bipolar disorder often go
  undiagnosed as they are considered “productive” individuals.</p>
<p>Being bipolar makes it easier for me to tap into my creative potential. My atypical brain chemistry helps me generate
  an impressive amount of ideas and scenarios in a short time. Highly intelligent and/or charismatic people with the
  condition often stand out in the crowd, which is why we seem to find so many among entertainment media and Fortune 500
  companies.</p>
<p>The clichés of alcoholic grizzled writers and overdosing rockstars are widespread, yet are very much steeped in
  reality. The wild mood swings, frequent depression, anxiety, and general sense of sadness often leads those with
  bipolarity to self-medication through mind-altering substances. I’ve had my shares of binge drinking days. Such abuse,
  which often provides temporary relief from my occasional bipolar <em>mal-de-vivre</em>, almost invariably makes my
  depression symptoms worse; for some, this often leads to thoughts of death and suicide attempts.</p>
<p>All of the above can serve as inspiration when playing bipolar characters and can help flesh out their backgrounds.
  Giving your characters histories helps you define how they’re likely to react to stressful situations. If the
  character is young, she may be inexperienced with her condition and not quite understand that her actions and
  reactions come from her and not her environment; she might blame everyone else for them. An older version of that
  character might be more self-aware and may have developed balances and checks—or bad habits—to be more socially
  functional. Such elements could be part of your character’s high concept if they define who they are at their core.
  However, I’d advise you to put anything related to bipolarity other aspects. Bipolarity doesn’t usually define who we
  are, but it is very much a part of how we interact with the world.</p>
<h3 id="bipolarity-and-aspects">Bipolarity and Aspects</h3>
<p>Consider taking aspects that play on the mercurial nature of a bipolar’s mood swing like: <strong>Quick to
    Anger</strong>, <strong>Loud Talker</strong>, <strong>Sulks When Contradicted</strong>, <strong>Easily
    Excited</strong>, <strong>Unnerving Laugh</strong>, <strong>Twitchy</strong>, <strong>What Were You
    Sayin’?</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>You could also pick aspects that play to the deeper, manic/depressive facets of the character: <strong>Make It a
    Double</strong>, <strong>I’ll Try Anything Once</strong>, <strong>Well Hello There</strong>, <strong>I’ll Sleep When
    I’m Dead</strong>, <strong>What’s the Point?</strong>, <strong>I Have No [redacted] to Give</strong>, <strong>Try to
    Keep Up</strong>, <strong>Obsessive Overthinker</strong>, etc.</p>
<h4 id="triggering-an-episode">Triggering an Episode</h4>
<p>Your aspects are the key to triggering a manic or depressive episode. A compel on the appropriate aspect is the
  trigger for either type of episode, but when you create your character and compose the aspect that establishes your
  bipolarity you should talk about what sorts of events tend to trigger you. They might include things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Drug use or overindulging in alcohol</li>
  <li>Death of a friend or loved one</li>
  <li>Major personal failure</li>
  <li>Loss of a job</li>
  <li>Failed relationship</li>
  <li>Insomnia or loss of sleep over time</li>
  <li>Change of seasons, especially winter’s darkness</li>
</ul>
<p>The episode results from a compel, whether initiated by the GM or by you. Being off your meds (see the Off My Meds
  condition, page XX.) makes this much more likely. Once the compel occurs and is accepted, decide whether the episode
  will be depressive or manic (see Exhausted and Hypomania conditions, pages XX and XX), and go from there.</p>
<h3 id="bipolarity-and-skills">Bipolarity and Skills</h3>
<p>Some skills might be easier or harder depending on where in your emotional cycle you land. If you’re feeling
  invincible, it might hurt you, or it might help you. Pay attention to where your character is, and how they’re
  feeling.</p>
<p>Your tendencies while in a manic phase might also affect your skills. If you tend to be loud and angry, it’s possible
  that you’re pretty good at Provoke and/or Fight. Perhaps that time you spent an entire weekend learning to weld gives
  you a higher Crafts skill.</p>
<h3 id="bipolarity-and-stunts">Bipolarity and Stunts</h3>
<p>There’s not a lot of advantage to be gained from bipolarity; the heightened productivity of mania is covered by the
  condition Hypomania (page XX). Otherwise, it’s all about harm mitigation:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>I Know The Warning Signs:</strong> You’ve been around the bipolar block a few times, so you know the signs
    of an approaching episode and how to ward it off. When your bipolarity aspect is compelled against you to trigger an
    episode, if your character takes some sort of self-care action, you may buy off that compel with one fewer fate
    point than usual.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk Reduction:</strong> Your friends, colleagues, and business partners know to watch for manic behavior
    and mitigate some elements of risky behavior. Choose one area of trouble you could get into—financial, legal,
    social, or health—and you won’t hurt yourself or others in that realm during a manic or hypomanic episode.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bipolarity-and-conditions">Bipolarity and Conditions</h3>
<p>Take the conditions Off My Meds (page XX), Exhausted (page XX), and Hypomania (page XX).</p>
<h3 id="player-advice">Player Advice</h3>
<p>Bipolar characters make for unpredictable, reckless action heroes; razor-sharp thinkers plagued by countless inner
  demons; or hyper-perceptive investigators with a penchant for making terrible decisions. Bipolarity is a great vessel
  to create rich characters who can shine while still having a darker, dramatic streak. It’s fine to play up the ever
  changing behavior of the character—but make sure it’s never used as an excuse to act however the hell you want at the
  table. Play your character from the perspective of putting yourself in the shoes of someone whose brain is either on
  fire or stuck in gloom.</p>
<p>In play, feel your character’s emotions strongly and follow a cyclical pattern for those emotions.</p>
<h3 id="gm-advice">GM Advice</h3>
<p>If you’re going to GM a game with bipolar characters, you should think about ways to create dramatically significant
  points of stress for the characters. Thus, you can create situations for people to gleefully embark on playing their
  characters as they want or make for thrilling opportunities for compels for you. Have a few triggering situations
  ready and don’t hesitate to discuss with the players themselves so they can share what kind of scenes and what kind of
  character development moments they want to explore.</p>
<h3 id="antagonists-with-bipolar-disorder">Antagonists with Bipolar Disorder</h3>
<p>Bipolar antagonists will be larger than life, likely narcissistic and bombastic. The trick here is to make them

<h2 id="ptsd-living-with-the-past-in-the-present">PTSD: Living With the Past in the Present</h2>
<p><em>This is Elsa again. I have post-traumatic stress disorder.</em></p>
<h3 id="living-with-post-traumatic-stress-disorder">Living with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</h3>
<p>Something horrible happened. Something you can’t process, but you can’t forget. Your brain reacts to that by
  protecting you—it’s the only thing it knows how to do. But by protecting you, by putting your memories into a box that
  you can only access when you’re terrified, the memories can be let out of their own Pandora’s box by a literal trigger
  from the past and that’s when things really get bad. PTSD is often discussed in relation to soldiers, and for good
  reason, but any traumatic event can cause PTSD.</p>
<p>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) manifests for people differently, but the basic earmarks are the same. Night
  terrors. Anxiety attacks. Flashbacks. Hypervigilance. Sensory memories. People have different experiences of the
  disorder, but they all experience some of the above. Looking up the American Psychiatric Association’s guidelines for
  diagnosis might help you to figure out how your character’s PTSD manifests, but the basics are these: intrusive
  thoughts, flashbacks/nightmares, or triggers which set off anxiety. These aren’t the only factors in diagnosing PTSD,
  but they can get you started on understanding what you’re doing.</p>
<p>One of the reactions that you might consider is hypervigilance; it keeps you on edge but also helps make sure you’re
  ready for anything that might happen. PTSD sometimes manifests with a sharp memory for everything, allowing you to
  pull clear memories from your past.</p>
<p>That being said, PTSD is not a positive. Triggers, flashbacks, and night terrors are all cause for difficulty,
  especially if they happen in the wrong place at the wrong time. A trigger might be straightforward, like <strong>Sound
    of a Gunshot</strong>, but it’s also possible that a trigger won’t necessarily be obvious. It’s harder to outrun
  your fears when they present as a certain kind of smell, like ammonia for a character whose hospitalizations were
  particularly traumatic. PTSD will make you avoidant, hyperaware, and sometimes unable to cope in the face of the thing
  you fear most.</p>
<h3 id="ptsd-and-aspects">PTSD and Aspects</h3>
<p>PTSD is a specific demon, one that preys on the specifics of your past; therefore you need to be specific about its
  execution. Naming an aspect for PTSD should be endemic to the kind of PTSD the character has. Night terrors isn’t
  really enough, but a specific night terror might be. A flashback isn’t enough, but an aspect naming the kind of
  flashback would be. You get the idea.</p>
<p>The CIA Agent with PTSD from a mission gone bad might have the aspect <strong>Hyperaware of Change</strong> which
  helps keep her safe from anything that might go wrong during a mission, but also makes it hard to let her guard down
  and relax, even among friends.</p>
<p>The thief who survived childhood abuse might have the aspect <strong>Memory for the Ages</strong> and can remember
  things that happened far in the past, thus being able to remember locations for heists with ease. Those memories may
  not be pleasant to call up, however.</p>
<h3 id="ptsd-and-skills">PTSD and Skills</h3>
<p>For the most part, PTSD doesn’t interact with skills. However, some skills may be affected during a flashback or a
  panic attack. Essentially, when your character is exposed to something triggering, they may not be able to perform,
  even with a high skill, at the same level as when they are fully functional. A character who was in a car accident may
  not be able to use their social skills to the highest level while they’re in a car, even if they have a skill which
  should normally transcend that.</p>
<p>See the condition Meltdown/Panic Attack/Anxiety Attack (page XX) for more ideas.</p>
<h3 id="ptsd-and-stunts">PTSD and Stunts</h3>
<p>PTSD-related stunts will likely have to do with hypervigilance or memory, and their applicable circumstances will
  relate to an applicable trigger. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Smell of Napalm in the Morning:</strong> Because my PTSD is triggered by the scent of gasoline or
    similar fuels, I get +2 to overcome, create advantages, or defend when reacting to threats that produce such smells,
    like fires, nearby vehicles, accelerants, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Hair-Trigger:</strong> Because my PTSD left me with a hair-trigger response to physical violence, I always
    go first in PC initiative order when I feel attacked by an opponent in my personal space.</li>
  <li><strong>Memory Like a Steel Trap:</strong> Because PTSD left me with inescapable memories, I never forget a smell;
    I get +2 to overcome or create advantages by recognizing specific smells I have encountered before.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ptsd-and-conditions">PTSD and Conditions</h3>
<p>Consider taking the conditions Exhausted (page XX), Meltdown/Panic Attack/Anxiety Attack (page XX), and Off My Meds
  (page XX).</p>
<h3 id="player-advice">Player Advice</h3>
<p>Invoking PTSD might involve using hypervigilance or flashbacks. Invoking a flashback means deliberately exposing your
  character to a trigger in order to give the rest of the players information about the story you’re telling. The
  Exhausted condition (page XX) adds mechanical weight to the effects of encountering a trigger in play.</p>
<p>Characters living with PTSD not only need to have a well-articulated concept for how their triggers operate, they
  also need to have a well-articulated past and a reason for why they have the condition. Write up a timeline of events
  around your character’s PTSD—how and when it developed, how they’ve learned to cope, what things are triggers for
  them. Delving into your character’s psyche might seem silly at the beginning of a game, but making the choice to play
  a character like this demands it for good roleplay, and it will make your story richer for having it.</p>
<h3 id="gm-advice">GM Advice</h3>
<p>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a mental illness brought on by circumstances outside of the individual’s control.
  PTSD isn’t something you’re born with, but something you gain as a result of lived experience—which means that PTSD is
  a mental illness your character can get during a game.</p>
<p>PTSD is like a permanent consequence in Fate Core, if you’re playing to make these kinds of choices. PTSD isn’t
  something that a player can have their character resolve between sessions—a GM would have to agree to at least a year
  long interlude in order to resolve that consequence as a result of gameplay.</p>
<h3 id="antagonists-with-ptsd">Antagonists with PTSD</h3>
<p>Try not to create antagonists whose PTSD is the reason for their evilness. For example, a soldier who wants revenge
  against the people who he was at war with isn’t a cool storyline for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>A woman who wants revenge against her rapist? It’s been done many times, and unless if a player has specifically
  asked to play through that scenario as a catharsis of some variety, it’s not something you should spring on someone.
</p>
<p>Stipulating that a villain has PTSD is often used as a get out of jail free card, something to complicate whether or
  not they should be allowed to continue doing evil things. That’s not just infuriating for people with PTSD who don’t
  want to do those things, but it reinforces the assumption that people with PTSD are always angry.</p>
<h1 id="rubber-hits-the-road-conditions-and-adaptations">Rubber Hits the Road: Conditions and Adaptations</h1>
<p>Now, let’s talk about mechanizing (or not) how your character experiences the world. We break this down into
  <strong>conditions</strong>—temporary experiences tied to your character’s disability—and <strong>adaptive
    devices</strong>, which may involve aspects, stunts, extras, and conditions. The following ideas and suggestions are
  intended to inspire, rather than prescribe. Use them to develop and describe your own.</p>
<p>Remember, playing a disabled character doesn’t require you to focus on the mechanics of disability. It might extend
  no farther than the high concept. If you’d prefer, roleplay your chronically ill character’s limited choices rather
  than trigger Exhausted. Maybe your blind character uses a white cane, but you’d rather use your focus your stunts
  elsewhere and use it as you might a limb—nothing mechanically significant.</p>
<h2 id="conditions">Conditions</h2>
<p>Conditions represent temporary states your character will sometimes be in due to their disability. They’re essential
  to modeling many disabilities and the limitations of some adaptive devices. If you don’t see a condition or device
  here that recreates the effect you’re interested in, use an existing one as a template to fill with your own ideas.
  Make your character <em>yours</em>.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-conditions-">What Are Conditions?</h3>
<p>A <strong>condition</strong> is a set of rules that is either in effect or not, based on whether a particular trigger
  has occurred in the game. A powered wheelchair runs low on battery power if you use it too much before you recharge
  it. An autistic person might feel overwhelmed in a loud, chaotic nightclub. Many disabled characters might have one or
  more conditions they are prone to (they might also have none!).</p>
<p>Conditions can be <strong>marked</strong>, which activates their special rules. These rules are different for each
  condition, and are described in detail in each condition’s section. Marking a condition activates it, and deactivating
  a condition is called <strong>recovering</strong>.</p>
<p>Each condition is rated with one of four ratings for what you have to do to recover from it: fleeting, sticky,
  lasting, and permanent.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fleeting:</strong> You recover from a fleeting condition when you have a moment to sit down, catch your
    breath, drink some water, or anything else that represents a momentary rest. Alternately, if the condition
    represents being without an adaptive device, regaining access to (or turning on, repairing, etc.) the device allows
    recovery.</li>
  <li><strong>Sticky:</strong> Sticky conditions last until you do something specific (often involving a skill check) to
    recover from it. Each sticky condition’s write-up describes the details.</li>
  <li><strong>Lasting:</strong> Like sticky conditions, you must do something specific to recover from a sticky
    condition, but it typically takes much longer—usually the end of not this game session, but the <em>next</em> one.
    Each lasting condition’s write-up describes the details.</li>
  <li><strong>Permanent:</strong> They’re not <em>exactly</em> permanent, but these don’t go away until a major
    milestone (<em>Fate Core System</em>, page 260).</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the words fleeting, lasting, etc. make no statement about the severity or impact of the
  condition—just its duration. Even a fleeting condition can be completely debilitating while it’s active.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-use-conditions">How To Use Conditions</h4>
<p>As examples, we provide several conditions for common situations disabled people might find themselves in. Use them
  as written, or use them as inspiration to create your own for your own character.</p>
<p>Remember that the point of the <em>Fate Accessibility Toolkit</em> is to help you make and play a character that
  works the way you want them to, not create a delicate and finely tuned mechanical balance of advantage vs.
  disadvantage. It is absolutely OK to decide to mark a condition <em>because it makes sense to</em>, regardless of the
  precise trigger. It is absolutely OK to ignore the recovery rules <em>when it makes sense to</em>.</p>
<p>Not every real-world condition related to a disability has a condition listed here. Some are better modeled as
  aspects, to be invoked and compelled in the usual way. Some are so severe that it’s essentially a taken out
  situation—so use it to explain being taken out of a scene. Some are such world-rocking events—a psychotic episode
  brought on by schizophrenia, for example—that it shouldn’t be triggered by rules, but by the player wanting it to
  happen to their character. Such events can’t be done justice by a limited set of game rules. If you’re playing a
  character like this, do some homework and learn what brings those situations on and the different ways they manifest,
  then roleplay that when you feel it’s appropriate to explore it—and never, <em>ever</em> for laughs.</p>
<h3 id="example-conditions">Example Conditions</h3>
<p>Here are a number of conditions players might find useful to make their character’s disability have more mechanical
  impact. Take as many as necessary to get your character to match what’s in your imagination, but not more—additional
  mechanical complication has a point of diminishing returns.</p>
<p><strong>Taking a condition</strong> means you add it to your character sheet as a condition your character might
  sometimes have. If you don’t take a condition, that situation might still happen to you but only in a narrative sense.
  The game rules won’t come into effect unless you choose to make them happen by taking the condition.</p>
<blockquote>
  <h4 id="sidebar-conditions-and-abled-characters">Sidebar: Conditions and Abled Characters</h4>
  <p>Some of these conditions might look a lot like situations that some people who don’t have a medically identified
    and diagnosed disability experience sometimes. Some otherwise abled people have a tremendously difficult time in
    crowds, for instance, and react in ways that look a lot like an autistic meltdown. Pregnancy can wallop a person
    with fatigue that works very much like the Exhausted condition. In cases like this, you could consider having access
    to that condition even as an able-bodied character—and from a purely rules standpoint, it would work just fine.</p>
  <p>Before you do, though, take the temperature of the table. First and foremost, these rules are intended to help
    disabled players see people like themselves in the game, and giving abled characters access to them might dilute
    that. Be sensitive to concerns expressed by disabled players, and be prepared to leave conditions to disabled
    characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <h4 id="sidebar-modeling-other-conditions">Sidebar: Modeling Other Conditions</h4>
  <p>We can’t possibly provide a condition for every way a disability can knock a person down and make their lives
    difficult, but we hope what’s here can serve as a starting point. Lots of widely varying disabilities manifest in
    ways that have similar effects. If the disability you’d like to represent in your game isn’t listed here explicitly,
    look for effects and conditions that appear similar. Grab a condition that looks like it’s close to what you want
    and adjust it to work the way you need it to—maybe that’s just changing some words, maybe it’s combining the trigger
    of one condition with the effect of another, maybe it’s adding a track and rules of your own design. As an added
    bonus, if you weren’t already, you’re now a game designer!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Exhausted (Lasting) <tt>[][][]</tt>:</strong> This condition covers a wide range of unrelated situations that
  share similar symptoms. It’s appropriate for characters with any fatigue disorder or chronic pain condition: many
  chronic illnesses, fibromyalgia, migraines, and chronic sleep disorders. It can also model the depressive episodes of
  a person with bipolar disorder or major depression or the effects of someone with PTSD encountering a trigger. The
  Exhausted condition represents more than just being tired; it’s the bone-deep weariness of someone whose body and mind
  simply can’t, or won’t.</p>
<p>Different people who endure pain and exhaustion have different metaphors for it; some call it being “out of spoons”
  (spoon theory, created by Christine Miserandino, was originally posted on “But You Don’t Look Sick”—see full resource
  information in Resources on page XX), some say they’re “turning into a pumpkin” (a la Cinderella’s carriage). Once
  you’re Exhausted, even the smallest actions require herculean effort and create ongoing costs.</p>
<p>This condition has a track of three boxes—think of these as your “spoons.” You never quite know how many you’ll have
  available on any given day, so each morning you pre-mark a random number of boxes. Roll one dF:</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>[-]</tt> means you immediately mark two boxes, leaving one available.</li>
  <li><tt>[0]</tt> means you mark one, leaving two available.</li>
  <li><tt>[+]</tt> means all three are available.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re using this condition to model a fatigue disorder, each scene during which you take an action requiring
  significant effort, mark another box. (What qualifies as “significant effort” is up to the player and GM.)</p>
<p>If you’re using this condition to model depression (whether from major depression or as a symptom of another
  disability such as PTSD), mark a box for each scene in which something triggers your depression—your failure hurting
  someone else, by seeing “evidence” of your own inadequacy (recognize how depression can warp perception of such
  things, of course!), and the like.</p>
<p>If you’re using the condition to model bipolar depressive episodes, skip the boxes. If one of your triggers occurs,
  consider treating it like a compel on your bipolarity aspect and mark <em>all</em> the boxes.</p>
<p>If you get through to the end of the day—meaning, you’re going to sleep—with at least one box still unmarked, clear
  out the track. Good job managing your spoons!</p>
<p>As soon as you mark the final box, you become Exhausted. While Exhausted, three effects come into play:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Whenever you take an action requiring significant effort (again, you and the GM work together to define that), you
    automatically suffer a one shift hit.</li>
  <li>You can’t clear your stress (but you can recover from consequences). You must recover from Exhausted first.</li>
  <li>You can’t clear the Exhausted track simply by sleeping; you must first recover from Exhausted first.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a lasting condition, recovery doesn’t happen until the end of the <em>next</em> session, and furthermore has two
  requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your character must sleep somewhere safe and reasonably comfortable.</li>
  <li>Your character must succeed on an overcome action against a difficulty of +4 using your Physique or Will skill
    (your choice). You can create advantages using new and existing aspects to make that overcome action easier. For
    example: Eat a <strong>Healthy and Satisfying Meal</strong>, or maybe go straight for the <strong>Comfort
      Food</strong>. It might be a good idea to make use of your <strong>Wheelchair</strong> or <strong>Scooter</strong>
    whenever possible during the session your character is Exhausted. Get your <strong>Weighted Blanket</strong> and
    <strong>Go to Bed Early</strong>. Let your <strong>Supportive Friends</strong> bring you a cup of tea.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have recovered, clear the Exhausted track and your stress.</p>
<blockquote>
  <h4 id="sidebar-exhausted-is-harsh">Sidebar: Exhausted Is Harsh</h4>
  <p>Yeah, the Exhausted condition can be really harsh. It’s designed to do two things: both force players to confront a
    very and variably limited resource—their own physical or emotional energy —and to encourage roleplaying some sort of
    self-care in the recovery from the condition.</p>
  <p>At first this way of roleplaying disability might feel artificial or “edutainment”-y, but as players become
    comfortable with the model, making hard choices about how their characters interact with the world won’t feel as
    hokey—and will help players feel, even if just for a moment, like a disabled character might in a real world
    setting.</p>
  <p>This isn’t recommended for games where players are facing off against the Great Old Ones, or are running for their
    lives in a superspy story. But in a <em>Leverage</em> style scenario trying to pull off a long con? Those questions
    could be interesting. More than anything, using Exhausted for a session to get players used to playing disabled
    characters with the appropriate consequences and choices in place might be a great way to start a campaign.</p>
  <p>If you want to model fatigue or depression or PTSD in a simpler way, lean on your aspect establishing your
    disability. That aspect can be compelled (by the GM, or by you) for a fate point in the way aspects usually are,
    which gets the same effect with much less bookkeeping and rules. But it also doesn’t quite model the
    unpredictability and resource management effort necessary to live with depression or fatigue. Each method has its
    advantages, and the choice is up to you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Hacked (Sticky) <tt>[]</tt>:</strong> This condition is for cybernetic implants and prostheses that have
  wireless data connections—which is most of them. Mark this condition when an opponent has hacked your device
  (requiring an overcome action against passive opposition of your Notice skill). Note that <em>you might not know</em>
  you’ve been hacked, but your GM will. The hacker might steal data that you’re witnessing, or feed you false data.</p>
<p>Determine that you’ve been hacked by telling the GM you’re checking for intruders in your implant, and making an
  overcome action with your Technology skill (or other applicable skill in your game) against Fair (+2) passive
  opposition. Recover when you notice and can take some action to evict the hacker’s signal.</p>
<p><strong>Hypomania (Sticky) <tt>[]</tt>:</strong> Strongly consider taking this condition if your character is Bipolar
  (especially Type II; Type I has far more severe mania than this condition represents). Mark the condition when your
  bipolarity aspect is compelled (see Bipolarity and Aspects, page XX).</p>
<p>While Hypomania is marked, you gain two aspects:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Manic Productivity</strong> (with one free invoke): Invoke to gain a bonus to solve problems, resist
    sleepiness, and defend against mental attacks.</li>
  <li><strong>Faulty Risk Assessment</strong> (with one free invoke for the GM): Compel to suggest making risky
    decisions that you will regret later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without treatment, the condition will go away on its own in a few days to a week—but by then, your risky behavior may
  have you in very, very serious trouble. The only way to make it go away quickly is medication—your character might
  have a stash, or they might need to seek help from a doctor, which may require a Resources overcome action if you
  don’t have insurance.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Focus (Sticky) <tt>[][][]</tt>:</strong> This condition models the toll that concentrating on using a
  complex device can take. Consider taking it if you wear anything with a direct neural input or that requires
  concentration. Mark one box at the end of any scene in which you make extensive use of the device (you and your GM
  decide what qualifies). Recover (clear all boxes) when you get a decent night’s sleep. If you mark the final box, you
  start having trouble focusing on the device, and your pain and lack of concentration render it useless—you suffer the
  same negatives as the Without My Device condition.</p>
<p><strong>Low On Charge (Sticky) <tt>[][][]</tt>:</strong> At the end of each scene you use a device that runs on
  batteries (powered wheelchairs, for example), mark a box of this condition. When it’s fully marked, the device starts
  running in low-power mode. You no longer have access to the stunts and aspects associated with it. Recover (clear all
  boxes in the track) by swapping out the battery, letting the battery charge overnight, or some similar action to
  restore full power.</p>
<p><strong>Making Payments (Permanent) <tt>[]</tt>:</strong> This represents cyberpunk/science fiction characters with
  cybernetic sensory implants that they don’t own. If you can’t pay for your implant, take this condition and mark it
  immediately. Recover only when you pay off the debt—at the next major milestone (<em>Fate Core System</em>, page 260).
  While this condition is marked, someone else owns the implant in your body. In the most benign cases, it might mean
  you need to watch or listen to the occasional advertisement streamed through the device directly into your brain. In
  less benign cases, the owner might capture data you witness through the device, to be used for whatever end they
  choose, or the owner might demand you perform services for them that you might otherwise not want to perform.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Debt (Lasting) <tt>[]</tt>:</strong> Mark this condition when recovering from a moderate or worse
  consequence representing a physical or mental injury, or when you recover from a disability-related condition by
  seeking professional medical attention. While in Medical Debt, you automatically fail any actions using your Resources
  skill. To recover, make an overcome roll with Resources (this one isn’t an autofail) against a passive opposition
  related to what caused the debt: +2 for recovery from a condition, +4 for a moderate consequence, +6 for a severe
  consequence. You may create advantages on existing or new aspects to help with that roll, such as
  <strong>Crowdfunding</strong>, <strong>Side Hustle</strong>, <strong>Family Money</strong>, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Meltdown/Panic Attack/Anxiety Attack (Fleeting) <tt>[]</tt>:</strong> Take this condition if your character
  is susceptible to meltdowns (some autistic people) or panic attacks (some people with anxiety disorders or PTSD). When
  you established that your character is autistic or susceptible to panic attacks, you discussed the sorts of things
  that might trigger a meltdown—sensory overload, crowds, specific fear triggers, etc. Mark this condition when an
  aspect is in play that declares that sort of thing is occurring, AND you mark the highest stress box on your mental or
  physical stress track.</p>
<p>Every person susceptible to meltdowns and panic attacks has a different reaction, so when you mark the condition
  choose one or two sets of symptoms you will exhibit:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are unable to speak (but may be able to write notes or sign, if you know how)</li>
  <li>You are unable to move without assistance</li>
  <li>You exhibit very strong, muddled emotions that are difficult to control</li>
  <li>You cannot tolerate anyone (or possibly anything) touching you</li>
  <li>You are overwhelmed by an urge to flee or get away from the situation</li>
  <li>You become dizzy and nauseated, feel chest pain, and might pass out</li>
  <li>You become short of breath and your heart races</li>
</ul>
<p>To recover from the condition, you must spend a little time away from the stimulus that caused it. Regardless of the
  particular symptoms, a person experiencing a meltdown or panic attack is under tremendous psychological (and perhaps
  physical) strain. Effects will likely last for hours after the worst of the symptoms have passed.</p>
<p><strong>Off My Meds (Sticky) <tt>[]</tt>:</strong> Take this condition if your character has disabilities or
  illnesses that they&#39;re on medication for. Mark this when you’ve missed your meds one or two doses in a row
  (depending on your medication). Recover when you’ve resumed taking them and have had a chance to rest to let them kick
  in again. Compels and invokes are affected in the same way as Without My Device (below).</p>
<p><strong>Without My Device (Fleeting) <tt>[]</tt>:</strong> Take this condition if your character is highly reliant on
  a particular adaptive device (and specify which one). Mark it when you are without that device—it’s stolen, broken, or
  otherwise out of service for whatever reason. Recover when you regain your device in a useful state.</p>
<p>When this condition is marked, it costs one fewer fate point for the GM to compel or invoke against you any of your
  aspects related to the disability this device assists with. Free invokes, such as might occur if an opponent creates
  an advantage on this aspect, are unaffected—in effect, this condition means your opponents <em>always</em> have a free
  invoke on your disability aspect. You’ll want to get that device back ASAP.</p>
<h2 id="adaptive-devices">Adaptive Devices</h2>
<p>This section tackles the kinds of adaptive devices that your characters might use to get around in an able bodied
  world, and will help you make decisions like whether or not your blind character has a white cane or a guide dog, or
  if your wheelchair is motorized or manual. People with different disabilities might use the same adaptive device with
  minor variations. These choices help you flesh out your character, and bonus, they’re also mechanical advantages for
  your character.</p>
<p>In the <em>Fate Accessibility Toolkit</em>, there are lots of ways to represent adaptive devices. Any adaptive device
  from a fidget cube to non-device things like a service animal can be represented by an aspect (using one of your
  character’s usual aspect slots) or stunt (using one of your character’s stunt slots or refresh points). For more
  mechanical representation, you can make the device an extra. You can also simply declare that you have one but give it
  no mechanical backing as a stunt or aspect; in this case it’s simply descriptive and has no rules impact at all (i.e.,
  you have a cane, but its presence or absence never affects dice rolls).</p>
<p>Starting on page XX, we go through a list of possible adaptive devices with suggested stunts and extras you might
  take or adapt if your character uses the device.</p>
<h3 id="adaptive-devices-and-stunts">Adaptive Devices and Stunts</h3>
<p>Lots of the disabilities discussed in this book list example stunts for adaptive devices—here are some additional
  examples that you can use as written, or use as inspiration to write your own.</p>
<p><strong>Crutch Shield (Fight):</strong> My crutch has a built-in steel shield made from the cuirass of a vanquished
  foe, granting +2 to defend actions made with Fight vs. attacks from other hand weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Hearing Aid Eavesdroppers (Deceive):</strong> My hearing aids are tuned to shift human speech into a
  frequency range my ears are most sensitive to. Gain +2 to Deceive overcome actions to eavesdrop on people who don’t
  think I’m paying attention to them or believe I can’t hear them.</p>
<p><strong>Weighted Blanket (Will):</strong> My weighted blanket is a great comfort to me. Gain +2 to Will overcome
  actions to recover from the Exhausted condition, and +2 to Physique create advantage actions to create aspects
  representing a good night’s rest.</p>
<p><strong>Sword Cane (Fight):</strong> The cane I use to assist my mobility conceals a 50 centimeter blade, and I gain
  Weapon:2 on successful attacks I make with it—and I can still use the scabbard as my cane while I fight.</p>
<p><strong>Tremor Sense (Notice):</strong> I have a magically enhanced sense of touch and vibration concentrated in my
  feet. When barefoot, I can easily sense floorplans and notice solid obstacles by tapping the ground. Additionally, I
  gain +2 to overcome actions made with Notice to detect ambushes and sense people trying to hide, regardless of
  lighting—provided the ground is solid. Sand, thick carpet, and footwear more substantial than thin socks interfere
  with this effect. (Yes, this is a magical adaptive device. Sometimes, though, fantasy tropes can be used to tell
  stories that aren’t based in the real world and that opens up possibilities.)</p>
<p><strong>Fidget Box (Will):</strong> A fidget box is a small plastic cube festooned with buttons and spinners and
  switches. When I can fiddle with it (in a jacket pocket, for instance) the Meltdown condition can’t affect me until
  the top <em>two</em> boxes of my Mental stress track are filled, rather than the top one.</p>
<p><strong>Stone String (Will):</strong> Because I use a stone on the end of a string as a fidget that helps anchor my
  thoughts, I can make attack actions with it using my Will skill rather than Fight.</p>
<p><strong>Arm Like a Prybar (Physique):</strong> My rigid prosthetic forearm is extremely tough, and gives me +2 to all
  overcome actions made with Physique to move heavy objects.</p>
<h3 id="adaptive-devices-and-extras">Adaptive Devices and Extras</h3>
<p>If you’d like to invest a bit more of your character’s mechanics into your device, you can treat many of the devices
  as an extra (<em>Fate Core System</em>, page 270). Each extra has a permission (typically an appropriate aspect),
  costs, and benefits (stunts, new skills, etc.).</p>
<p>Not all adaptive devices have extras listed. Some devices, like hearing aids, are better suited to representation
  through a single aspect. Each adaptive extra has a base cost, and many have varying additional costs depending on how
  many optional elements you choose.</p>
<p><strong>Skills:</strong> You may need to select a particular skill, costing you skill ranks. For example, effective
  use of a wheelchair might require you to have ranks in Drive (for powered chairs) or Athletics (for manually-driven
  chairs).</p>
<p><strong>Stunts:</strong> All stunts related to the device cost one of your character’s stunt slots or refresh points.
</p>
<h3 id="choosing-your-adaptive-devices">Choosing Your Adaptive Devices</h3>
<p>The following table is intended to inspire rather than confine your choices. For instance, many blind people do not
  have service animals, even more Deaf people do not. But some do. Consider how your character engages with a world
  designed primarily for those without disabilities and choose adaptive devices that feel appropriate for your character
  and the setting.</p>
<h4 id="disabilities-and-adaptive-devices">Disabilities and Adaptive Devices</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Blindness: service animals, wheelchairs, canes, prosthetics, glasses, human assistant, communication device.</li>
  <li>Deafness: service animals, hearing aids or cochlear implants, communication device.</li>
  <li>Mobility: service animals, wheelchairs, canes, prosthetics, human assistant.</li>
  <li>Dwarfism: service animals, wheelchairs, canes, prosthetics, human assistant.</li>
  <li>Chronic illness: service animals, wheelchairs, canes, human assistant.</li>
  <li>Synesthesia: glasses, earplugs.</li>
  <li>Autism: service animals, human assistant, communication device, coping device (fidgets or anchors), earplugs.</li>
  <li>Depression: human assistant, communication device, coping device.</li>
  <li>Anxiety: service animals, human assistant, communication device, coping device, earplugs.</li>
  <li>Schizophrenia: human assistant, coping device.</li>
  <li>Bipolar: human assistant, communication device, coping device.</li>
  <li>PTSD: service animals, human assistant, communication device, coping device, earplugs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="guide-dogs-and-service-animals">Guide Dogs and Service Animals</h3>
<p>Some characters—such as those who are blind, who are epileptic or live with seizures, or who have anxiety or
  PTSD—might have service animals who work for them to make their lives easier. A character with a service animal can
  use that animal (most often a dog) in several ways as a mechanic to negotiate with their disability in game.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A blind character with a guide dog, for example, can navigate spaces faster than they would with a cane (page XX).
    The dogs give them a better sense of their environment, because the dog can see.</li>
  <li>A character with PTSD or anxiety could have a dog who is trained to help them navigate an anxiety attack, thus
    lessening the effects and repercussions of such an incident.</li>
  <li>A service dog or cat for a character with seizures would be trained to tell a player character when they are
    having a seizure.</li>
  <li>A service dog for someone who is Deaf could be trained to tell someone when their phone is ringing, if they’re
    being followed, or if someone is at the door.</li>
</ul>
<p>An important note about guide dogs and service dogs in general is that they are still dogs with dog brains.
  Sometimes, they’re going to act like a normal dog would—and that’s a complication, isn’t it? This could be even more
  true for less traditional service animals, like a monkey or a ferret.</p>
<p>You should describe some basic things about your service animal. What’s its name, and what breed is it? What is its
  personality like? What services is it trained to provide? Service animals can be trained to perform all sorts of
  actions. You don’t need to represent them all with a stunt—any guide dog will stop you at a busy street curb. Any
  suitably trained service dog will help you pick up your house keys. Very few are trained for combat—the dog doesn’t
  get a separate turn in fights, and doesn’t make attacks. It might defend you from attackers, however.</p>
<p>Perhaps the easiest way to model a service animal is for the player to devote an aspect to it (<strong>My Guide Dog,
    Jonesy</strong>) and to rate that animal as a skill on the character’s pyramid (Good (+3) Jonesy). Whenever the
  character has to make a roll involving using that service animal, such as using Jonesy to navigate a particularly
  complex area, they roll that skill. Most of the time, don’t bother with the roll.</p>
<h4 id="extra-service-animal">Extra: Service Animal</h4>
<p><strong>Permission:</strong> An aspect establishing a suitable disability—usually blindness, but other disabilities
  can also benefit from a service animal.</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Skill ranks in the skill Service Dog—add this skill to your skill array as you would any other
  skill. The extra also uses one of your stunt slots or a point of refresh.</p>
<p><strong>Skill:</strong> Service Dog. Use it whenever your service dog does something within a service dog’s purview:
  sensing danger, intimidating foes, fetching dropped items, etc. You cannot make attack actions with this skill.</p>
<h5 id="aspect">Aspect</h5>
<p>Compose an aspect like <strong>My Service Collie Jack</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Invoke:</strong> Jack snarls menacingly at a threatening goon! Jack’s sharp senses notice approaching danger.
</p>
<p><strong>Compel:</strong> Jack’s in danger and needs to be rescued! That lady dog sure does smell nice and Jack
  <em>really</em> wants to get to know her better…</p>
<h5 id="stunts">Stunts</h5>
<p>You may choose one free stunt from this list of examples or compose your own.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t You Hurt My Friend:</strong> Jack willingly faces down those who would attack you. You may roll your
  Service Dog skill to defend against attacks against you made unarmed or using hand-to-hand weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Table Top:</strong> You give Jack a subtle hand signal, and he maneuvers behind an opponent’s knees. You give
  that opponent a shove, sending them tumbling. Gain +2 to overcome or create advantage actions using your Service Dog
  skill made to trip a standing opponent.</p>
<p><strong>Light-“Fingered” Pooch:</strong> Jack is trained to find and retrieve numerous common items—the training was
  to help you when you misplace your cell phone, but it turns out he’s great at petty larceny. Roll your Service Dog
  skill with a +2 bonus to overcome actions when picking pockets, burgling from purses, or silently nicking items out of
  a drawer.</p>
<h5 id="variations">Variations</h5>
<p><strong>Other Animals:</strong> Instead of a dog, use a cat or monkey—but make sure you read up a bit on non-dog
  service animals to get a feel for what they’re capable of.</p>
<p><strong>Fantasy:</strong> Instead of a dog perhaps it’s a tiny dragon, magical invisible force, or a demon or spirit
  you’ve bargained with.</p>
<p><strong>Sci-Fi:</strong> Instead of a dog perhaps it’s a robot, a synthetic life form genetically engineered to look
  like a dog, or an animal of alien origin.</p>
<h4 id="service-animals-in-conflict">Service Animals in Conflict</h4>
<p>If a character has an omnipresent service animal, realize that causing harm to that animal in the game might be
  unpleasant or traumatic to the player—and to other players around the table. As such, it’s often best for the animal
  to “fade into the background” when violence starts; it doesn’t attack enemies, and they don’t attack it. Plus, most
  service animals are trained to not engage in violence, so their instinct is to get out of danger—and to take their
  human with them!</p>
<h3 id="wheelchairs">Wheelchairs</h3>
<p>Wheelchairs are vehicles. That’s the first thing to understand when you play a character who uses one. The second is
  that you have some decisions to make: based on the disability that your character has, you need to select what kind of
  chair your character uses.</p>
<p>A paraplegic can use either a manual wheelchair or a motorized wheelchair, whereas a quadriplegic is only able to use
  a motorized chair in order to move around. Someone with fatigue or chronic pain may need a scooter while out and
  about, but walk with a cane or walker while at home where they can rest when necessary. What are your character’s
  needs? What kind of chair will best suit those needs?</p>
<h4 id="types-of-wheelchairs">Types of Wheelchairs</h4>
<p>Manual wheelchairs come in a few different types, but they’re all the same in terms of propulsion: They are moved by
  the user’s arms or sometimes feet, or are pushed by another person. They can be super lightweight, clunky, brightly
  colored. They can have rims. They can be designed to support participation in various sports and other physical
  activities (hand-operated bicycling, contact sports like “murderball,” team sports like volleyball or basketball,
  etc.) or for specific kinds of terrain (e.g., sandy, muddy, rocky).</p>
<p>When designing your chair, think about the function of the wheelchair and what kind of terrain it is intended for. It
  may also be helpful to know whether it has handles for assistive pushing. Everything else is narrative detail about
  how your chair looks, etc.</p>
<p>Mechanical chairs are bigger and heavier, and they do not, for the most part, fold. They often have a sort of evil
  mastermind or borg chair look to them. They are generally controlled by a manual joystick and buttons to adjust chair
  height, tilt, etc. Users are significantly faster and more independent than those with a manual chair, but manual
  chairs are more portable and easily accessed. Motorized chairs also tend to perform poorly in soft terrain.</p>
<p>Players should consider perspective when playing a character who is a wheelchair user. A manual wheelchair is usually
  at about crotch height with the rest of the world. Great for checking out people’s butts, but less great if you want
  someone to notice you when you’re wheeling down a busy street. On the other hand, wheelchairs are also something
  people like to avoid looking at—because they don’t want to stare. Because of where the average person’s focus is, a
  wheelchair can be almost invisible, and by extension, the person who uses the chair becomes invisible too.</p>
<p>Characters with any kind of wheelchair have less access to things like bars, counters, and high shelves. Motorized
  wheelchairs are often higher off the ground than manual ones, so that might change what you can or can’t reach, and
  some include a seat lift option to reach even higher. Wheelchair users often carry a “grabber” to mitigate the
  challenge of reaching up or down. The spatial experience of sitting down in a wheeled chair while interacting with the
  world can be compared to the experience of an adult who is the height of a nine year old.</p>
<p>Wheelchairs can have different kinds of tires and wheels for different purposes. It’s worth a quick search to see
  what your character’s options might be. There are wheels and tires for beach adventures, offroad trekking,
  handcycling, court sports, racing, and so forth.</p>
<h4 id="extra-hand-propelled-wheelchair">Extra: Hand-Propelled Wheelchair</h4>
<p>Many people with mobility impairments use wheelchairs, but some people really become artists with their chairs.
  That’s you. You don’t have to be a full-time user—many wheelchair users can walk well enough, but require the option
  of wheeling around when necessary; this doesn’t mean they can’t be really good with their ride.</p>
<p><strong>Permission:</strong> An aspect establishing a appropriate disability.</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> One of your free stunt slots or a point of refresh. Athletics skill of at least Fair (+2),
  reflecting the physical strength and endurance that develops from frequent manual wheelchair propulsion.</p>
<h5 id="aspects">Aspects</h5>
<p>You may compose an additional aspect like <strong>Hell on Wheels</strong> or <strong>Wheelchair Marathoner</strong>.
  Talk with your GM about how you imagine those aspects being compelled and invoked.</p>
<h5 id="stunts">Stunts</h5>
<p>Choose two stunts from this list. Additional stunts related to your wheelchair must occupy your character’s regular
  stunt slots or points of refresh.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Need For Speed (Athletics):</strong> You’re the fastest around when it comes to human-powered travel.
    When you’re in your chair, you gain +2 to all overcome actions made with Athletics in chases or races when your
    opposition is on foot.</li>
  <li><strong>Crowd Control (Athletics):</strong> You know how to avoid traffic, pedestrians, and cyclists. When you’re
    trying to move fast in your chair, aspects reflecting physical obstacles (crowds, pallets of cargo, spilled garbage
    cans, etc.) can’t be invoked against you—unless they outright prevent movement (locked doors, walls, steep stairs,
    closed gates).</li>
  <li><strong>Offroad Chair (Athletics):</strong> Your chair is equipped with large wheels intended for offroad travel.
    You gain +2 to all overcome and create advantage Athletics actions related to movement and positioning when on
    grass, gravel, sand, snow, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottomless Saddlebags (Resources):</strong> That bag slung across the back of your chair always seems to
    have the perfect thing for any occasion. Gain +2 to create advantage actions with the Resources skill to create
    situation aspects for having exactly the right tool, gizmo, item, or supplies.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="conditions">Conditions</h5>
<p>If you rely on your chair to the point where you’re at a substantial disadvantage without it, take Without My Device

<h4 id="extra-powered-wheelchair-scooter">Extra: Powered Wheelchair/Scooter</h4>
<p>If your wheelchair or scooter has a motor, this might be the one for you. Cool pair of aviator sunglasses optional.
</p>
<p><strong>Permission:</strong> An aspect establishing an appropriate disability.</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> One of your free stunt slots or a point of refresh. Drive skill of at least Fair (+2),

<p><strong>Special:</strong> Use the Drive skill to operate your chair—where someone on foot would roll Athletics, you
  roll Drive.</p>
<h5 id="aspect">Aspect</h5>
<p>Compose a free aspect like <strong>Mozart in a Go-Kart</strong> or <strong>Wheels for Any Occasion</strong>.</p>
<h5 id="stunts">Stunts</h5>

  must occupy one of your character’s free stunt slots or a point of refresh.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Made a Few Special Modifications Myself (Drive):</strong> You (or your mechanic) have upgraded the drive
    motors and suspension on your ride to give it some real top end velocity. When you’re in your chair, you gain +2 to
    all overcome actions made with Athletics in chases or races when your opposition is on foot.</li>
  <li><strong>Gunship (Drive):</strong> Your chair has an axial-mounted submachine gun. When you use it to make an
    attack with Drive, gain Weapon:2 on successful attacks.</li>
  <li><strong>Amphib (Drive):</strong> Your chair is designed to navigate water as easily as ground—it can traverse calm
    bodies of water.</li>
  <li><strong>Solar Charger (Drive):</strong> You have a highly efficient solar charging station for your chair. If you
    spend a scene outdoors in bright sunlight, the track of the condition Low On Charge clears. You can also use the
    charging station to charge other devices.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="conditions">Conditions</h5>
<p>You must take the condition Low On Charge (page XX). If you rely on your chair to the point where you’re at a
  substantial disadvantage without it, take Without My Device (page XX).</p>
<h5 id="variations">Variations</h5>
<p><strong>Fantasy:</strong> Instead of wheels, a flying carpet or a small but strong extraplanar pack animal to handle
  curbs and stairs</p>
<p><strong>Sci-Fi:</strong> Instead of wheels, repulsorlifts or leg-like mechanisms to handle curbs and stairs</p>
<h3 id="canes">Canes</h3>
<p>The use of a cane may be temporary or permanent. Selecting what kind of cane your character might use is important,
  not just to how their character deals with their disability, but also as a way for them to express their character.
  Canes are also blunt force weapons. A straight up and down wooden cane can be used to bash down a person or a door, a
  white cane might secretly snap out to be a set of nunchucks, and of course there are many variants of the swordcane—a
  cane can hide blades, poisons, and many other things.</p>
<p>Dr. Gregory House had a cane decorated with flames going up the side, whereas a hacker elf might have a cane made of
  pure steel with a glowing internal shaft. Your character’s cane is an extension of their body, not just in terms of
  how it supports them, but also in terms of how it displays their nature.</p>
<h4 id="types-of-canes">Types of Canes</h4>
<p>Canes come in a few different varieties.</p>
<p>There are stabilizing walking canes. A character who uses a regular walking cane might have a permanent injury
  causing a limp, they might have a prosthetic leg which requires extra load bearing support, or they might have a
  seizure disorder or pain disorder.</p>
<p>For other disabilities, stabilizing crutches may be more appropriate. Characters with arm braced (cuff) crutches are
  typically those with disabilities like Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, or any other condition which might affect their
  balance or ability to bear weight, including pain conditions.</p>
<p>And then of course there’s the white cane for characters with low vision and blindness.</p>
<h4 id="white-canes">White Canes</h4>
<p>Rather than a guide dog (page XX), characters with low vision and blindness might use a white cane instead. There are
  three types of white cane that your character might select from.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>A standard long white cane.</strong> Completely white, or white until the last foot, which is red. It
    doesn’t fold, it doesn’t do anything fancy, it just is. These generally have a metal tip on the end, and are free
    from the National Federation for the Blind in the United States. (But only get one if you’re actually blind, folks.)
  </li>
  <li><strong>A folding white cane.</strong> These are made out of either aluminum or carbon, fold into 6 distinct
    sections, and can be stuffed inside a backpack. They fold up and snap out kind of like nunchucks. You’ve seen these
    on shows like <em>Dare__devil</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Stabilizing white cane.</strong> This is painted like the red and white cane, but has the shape and use of
    a standard weight bearing walking cane for people with multiple disabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>To play a character who uses a white cane, you have to understand a little bit about how it works. The user picks up
  the cane in their dominant hand, and sweeps (the technical term is “scans”) it along the ground; the tip of the cane
  touching the ground acts as a radar or sonar reader. As the cane sweeps across the ground, it gives the user a sense
  of what kind of ground they’re walking on, bumps into objects telling the user to stop and find out where that object
  is so that they can move around it, and catches in sidewalk cracks telling the user where to step carefully. It also
  tells them where there are stairs and curbs. Basically, a white cane user understands their environment through the
  feel of the cane. Someone who is well trained in the use of the cane almost uses it as a new sense, a little like
  tactile echolocation.</p>
<p>Weaponizing a cane is something you can do fairly easily by describing it as an aspect (<strong>Spiky End
    Point</strong> comes to mind) and talking about what makes it a good weapon.</p>
<p>Alternately, it could be described as a stunt:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>My Trusted Cane (Fight):</strong> Because I always have my heavy walking cane with me, I get +2 to defend
    actions with Fight made against melee attacks.</li>
  <li><strong>“Upgraded” White Cane (Fight):</strong> Because I “upgraded” my telescoping white cane with a sharp point,
    I get +2 to attack actions made with the Fight skill, when my opponent doesn’t expect my attack.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="extra-white-cane">Extra: White Cane</h4>
<p><strong>Permission:</strong> An aspect establishing a blindness disability.</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> This extra occupies one of your character’s stunt slots or uses a point of refresh. You must
  take the Without My Device condition.</p>
<h5 id="aspect">Aspect</h5>
<p>You may compose a free character aspect like <strong>Cane Expertise</strong> which does not count against your usual
  aspect slots.</p>
<h5 id="stunts">Stunts</h5>
<p>You may choose two free stunts from this list (or compose your own).</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Effortless Parry (Fight):</strong> You know exactly how to put an attacker off balance with a simple flick
    of your cane. You gain +2 to defend actions with the Fight skill when an opponent attacks you with a knife, sword,
    club, fist, or the like.</li>
  <li><strong>Stun Stick (Fight):</strong> The handle of your cane conceals a powerful electrical stunning device, which
    delivers a viciously painful shock through the cane’s tip. Once per scene, you can apply <strong>Shocked and
      Stunned</strong> to the target of your successful Fight attack made with the cane.</li>
  <li><strong>Trapfinder (Notice):</strong> You have optimized your cane for locating traps, snares, false floors, and
    other pitfalls you might encounter while exploring ancient temples and ruins. Gain +2 to overcome actions with
    Notice to find traps.</li>
  <li><strong>Step Lightly (Stealth):</strong> Your touch with the cane is delicate enough to give you a sense of where
    to step to be as quiet as possible. Gain +2 to overcome actions with Stealth when opposed by an opponent’s Notice.
  </li>
</ul>
<h5 id="conditions">Conditions</h5>
<p>You must take Without My Device (page XX).</p>
<h5 id="variations">Variations</h5>
<p><strong>Fantasy:</strong> The cane might be a wizard’s staff or druid’s shillelagh.</p>
<p><strong>Sci-Fi:</strong> The cane might be a force projector or energy beam rather than a stick made of solid matter,
  or might contain other hidden devices which should be represented by appropriate stunts.</p>
<h3 id="prosthetics">Prosthetics</h3>
<p>Prosthetic limbs are a fairly common type of disability that we often don’t notice because of how they look in modern
  day. Common because military service can often result in the loss of a limb, common because of celebrity athletes
  whose cheetah feet have become part of their cult of personality. If you saw <em>Mad Max Fury Road</em>, you saw
  Imperator Furiosa’s incredible wrench hand. People with prosthetic arms, legs, hands, eyes, etc., face a few
  challenges, most of them related to navigating a world that isn’t designed for their bodies. Hands may not be able to
  open doors (if there were a case for a service velociraptor anywhere in this book…), legs may be caught in things,
  limbs might come off because of a faulty joint. Even eyes have prosthetic limbs available to them—Elsa wears one every
  day, called a scleral shell. Technology here is an advantage, a tool, and sometimes even a nifty gadget.</p>
<p>Characters with prosthetic limbs might wear cheetah feet or blades for running; they might have a 3D-printed hand or
  a fully articulated steam powered hand. Considering possible leaps and bounds in design and biotech, how a prosthetic
  might appear in your story makes it a little more unique and exciting.</p>
<h4 id="extra-cybernetic-limb">Extra: Cybernetic Limb</h4>
<p>A cybernetic limb is suitable in many science fiction/cyberpunk settings. It’s made of and powered by exotic
  materials and is controlled by a direct neural link—possibly directly wired into the wearer’s nervous system, or
  possibly wirelessly linked to a brain implant. Be careful not to erase the disability—pay attention to the fatigue and
  pain such a device might cause with extended use.</p>
<p><strong>Permission:</strong> An aspect establishing an appropriate disability.</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> One stunt slot or point of refresh. Also, justification for having paid the immense cost of
  such a device—an aspect establishing your character as wealthy, a Resources skill of at least +3, a debt owed to a
  powerful creditor, etc. If you can’t pay for it, take the Making Payments condition.</p>
<h5 id="aspects">Aspects</h5>
<p>Compose a free aspect like <strong>The Best Hand Money Can Buy</strong> or <strong>I Don’t Even Own My Own
    Leg</strong>.</p>
<h5 id="stunts">Stunts</h5>
<p>Choose two free stunts from this list, or design your own. Any additional stunts you take regarding this device each
  come at the cost of one of your stunt slots or a point of refresh.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Smuggler’s Compartment (Deceive):</strong> Your prosthesis has a concealed compartment large enough to
    contain a tool, small weapon, or some other contraband where it is invisible to scanning. Spend a fate point to have
    a device where you shouldn’t have it.</li>
  <li><strong>Frickin’ Lasers (Shoot):</strong> Your prosthesis contains a built-in blaster, giving you Weapon:2 when
    you make Shoot attack actions with it.</li>
  <li><strong>Autoinjector (Physique):</strong> Your prosthesis contains a system that automatically dispenses a
    bioengineered steroid that kickstarts your physical healing. Once per session, at the cost of a fate point, you can
    reduce the severity of a moderate consequence that’s physical in nature to a mild consequence (if your mild
    consequence slot is free), or erase a mild consequence altogether.</li>
  <li><strong>A Single Bound (Athletics):</strong> Your leg is enormously strong and allows you to make superhuman
    leaps. Gain +2 to overcome actions made with Athletics related to climbing and leaping.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="conditions">Conditions</h5>
<p>Take one of the following conditions; an extra one or two would be appropriate if you choose: Exhausted (page XX),
  Hacked (page XX), Limited Focus (page XX), Low On Charge (page XX), Making Payments (page XX).</p>
<h5 id="variations">Variations</h5>
<p><strong>Fantasy:</strong> A magical or enchanted limb</p>
<h4 id="extra-cybernetic-sensory-implants">Extra: Cybernetic Sensory Implants</h4>
<p>Cybernetic or bionic sensory prosthetics are a standard trope of cyberpunk and science fiction settings. They’re
  usually manufactured devices, made of exotic materials and full of electronics. The way many people think of these
  devices makes it <em>very</em> easy to ignore your character’s disability entirely—it’s a delicate balance to make
  them useful without making them erasing.</p>
<p>Make sure you establish with the GM what it can and can’t do, or what trouble it brings you. Does that cybernetic eye
  fail to interface properly with the part of your brain responsible for facial recognition? Maybe an intermit
  malfunction translates text you read with it into a language you don’t understand. Does the aural implant require
  expensive recalibration on a regular basis? Does your corporate sponsor only <em>lease</em> you the implant? Does the
  device give you crushing headaches, requiring you to deactivate it when it’s not essential?</p>
<p><strong>Permission:</strong> You must have a disability aspect that corresponds to your implant.</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> One stunt slot or point of refresh. Also, justification for having paid the immense cost of
  such a device—an aspect establishing your character as wealthy, a Resources skill of at least +3, a debt owed to a
  powerful creditor, etc. If you can’t pay for it, take the Making Payments condition.</p>
<h5 id="aspects">Aspects</h5>
<p>Compose an aspect like <strong>The Company’s Robotic Eye</strong> or <strong>Infrasonic Implant</strong>.</p>
<h5 id="stunts">Stunts</h5>
<p>Choose two stunts for free. Additional stunts require use of your character’s stunt slots or refresh.</p>
<p><strong>Expanded Frequency Range (Notice):</strong> The device allows you to see or hear beyond typical wavelength
  limits—infrared or ultraviolet for eyepieces, or infrasound or ultrasound for ear implants.</p>
<p><strong>Extended Range (Notice):</strong> The device allows you to zoom in to distant events as if it were a
  telescope, or hear minute sounds at a distance.</p>
<p><strong>Embedded Recording (Notice):</strong> On mental command, your device can record what it sees or hears, and
  wirelessly upload it to a server. It can play back directly into your mind what it hears or sees.</p>
<h5 id="conditions">Conditions</h5>
<p>Consider taking the conditions Making Payments (page XX) or Hacked (page XX).</p>
<h3 id="other-senses">Other Senses</h3>
<p>Blind characters will build extensive mental maps to find their way around cities that they navigate—for example, a
  character who has lived in one city for part of their lives might take a minute to re-orient themselves into a tactile
  map of the city, but once they understand their directions, they can run off and go anywhere. A blind person often has
  some kind of system for how they get around, whether it’s through landmarks (low vision characters can still see) or
  by the way the street changes from cobbles to bricks in the span of a block.</p>
<p>With the advent of smartphones, characters also have the option of headphones reading them the directions they need,
  but a blind character might also navigate using very specific directions provided by sighted characters using no
  visual landmarks, only counted block numbers.</p>
<p>Characters who are blind also likely navigate using what they feel under their feet. A character might know what room
  they’re in based on whether a room has tile, carpet, or hardwood. The sense of what’s below them might very well give
  them a better understanding of where they are than a sighted person.</p>
<p>GMs should be aware of the surroundings they give their PCs, knowing what their disabled characters would be aware of
  that able bodied PC’s might not be, such as the kind of floor, or whether there’s a wheelchair ramp into the library.
  Access and the lack of it are important things to know about your setting.</p>
<blockquote>
  <h4 id="sidebar-human-echolocation">Sidebar: Human Echolocation</h4>
  <p>Some blind people can echolocate. They’ve taught themselves how to do this by clicking their tongues and navigating
    based on the way the sound comes back to them. It’s actual echolocation. Not every blind person can do this, but
    those who can are easily findable on the internet to learn more about the how. If you play a character with this
    particular ability, you likely won’t use a cane or a dog, but you also aren’t likely to be multiply disabled because
    your ability to hear should be exemplary in order to master this particular skill, and a wheelchair or cane might
    make sound distractions which would affect your ability to echolocate.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="glasses">Glasses</h3>
<p>Glasses and other corrective lenses, such as contact lenses, are perhaps the most common adaptive devices. If you
  don’t use them yourself, you almost certainly know someone who does. Especially as they get older, people often end up
  with several different lenses to solve different vision issues. Glasses and contact lenses aren’t perfect
  solutions—they can be uncomfortable, they often don’t fully solve the problem, they’re inconvenient, they fog up with
  annoying regularity—but they’re so common that we often hardly think of them as adaptive devices.</p>
<p>Even if your character needs glasses, it may not need to be more than a narrative detail that isn’t reflected in the
  mechanics. If you want your glasses to really matter to your character, consider an aspect like <strong>I Look Awesome
    in My Nerd Glasses</strong>, which could be invoked when you play on the stereotype of people in glasses being
  smarter or more serious, and compelled when your glasses fog up, break, or are misplaced.</p>
<p>To make your glasses an extra, see Cybernetic Sensory Implants on page XX.</p>
<h4 id="corrective-lenses">Corrective Lenses</h4>
<p>A variety of vision problems—such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism—can be helped with corrective
  lenses. Even people with relatively good vision may require corrective lenses to help them see in certain situations
  or to improve focus issues, but they can function without the lenses if they choose to. Focus issues cover a wide
  range, though, and many people can’t do much without their glasses. Some can’t really see anything without corrective
  lenses.</p>
<h4 id="sunglasses">Sunglasses</h4>
<p>While we should all wear sunglasses to protect our eyes when the sun is bright, for some people it’s a necessity.
  Photophobia—a sensitivity to light—is a symptom of many illnesses, headaches, and conditions. It can be a side effect
  to certain medications. People with light colored eyes are frequently sensitive to bright light, especially sunlight.
  Blue light from computer screens or harsh indoor fluorescent lighting irritates many people. Some people are bothered
  by any kind of light. Dark or colored lenses of varying types can help deal with these issues by blocking or reducing
  certain types of light.</p>
<h4 id="protective-lenses">Protective Lenses</h4>
<p>Having glasses in front of your eyes inherently protects them from being hit by something, thus safety glasses are
  required when working with machines, chemicals, etc. If your eyes have difficulty reacting quickly, however,
  protective lenses may be a daily tool. For instance, if you’re blind in one eye, your depth perception and side vision
  are impaired. The blink reflex may be slowed or nonexistent. Protective lenses help make that slow reflex less of a
  danger.</p>
<h4 id="color-corrective">Color-Corrective</h4>
<p>Color-corrective glasses for those who are colorblind do exist. They’re not covered by any insurance or discount
  program, and they’re a little expensive ($400 or so), but they exist, and they mostly work (though not for everyone).
  They help the wearer distinguish colors more easily, and they make everything a little more vibrant, but they’re not a
  perfect solution. It’s a bit like having a prescription for regular glasses that doesn’t <em>quite</em> get you to
  20/20.</p>
<h3 id="hearing-aids-cochlear-implants">Hearing Aids &amp; Cochlear Implants</h3>
<p>Hearing aids and cochlear implants were covered a bit in the Deafness chapter (page XX) but here’s some extra
  material you might want to know about.</p>
<p>Both hearing aids and cochlear implants can be used to manage hearing loss. A character who uses either of these
  kinds of aids may not require mechanics beyond a related aspect, but it will change the way that your character
  interacts with the world, and there are rules.</p>
<p>A character who wears a hearing aid in one or both ears only has the benefits of that aid when the hearing aids are
  in. A character who takes their hearing aids out at night or to swim might not hear something when the aid is out.</p>
<p>One of the complications of having an aid is that they are breakable, whether because you set your hearing aid on the
  table and a dragon ate it, or because you accidentally went swimming with a Siren. Neither cochlear implants or
  hearing aids are impervious to water.</p>
<p>Hearing aids and cochlear implants are also not a perfect solution. Hearing aids are like a small microphone in your
  ear; depending on the kind you have (in the ear, behind the ear) you might have a microphone that faces front, and you
  can’t hear people behind you, or you might not always hear people because the wax trap is full. Cochlear implants are
  not an exact replica of hearing; for reference—we’re not kidding—go to the Wikipedia entry on cochlear implants where
  you can listen to Beethoven’s 5th Symphony as heard through one. It gives you an idea of what that’s like.</p>
<p>A hearing aid is also a tool that you have to learn how to use; a character who gets one put in has a learning curve
  for how they hear, as well as learning what words sound like. They might be surprised by how loud the sound of
  crumpling paper is, or that bacon makes a sound when it hits a frying pan. A hearing aid (except in the far future) is
  not an exact method for adjusting someone’s hearing.</p>
<p>To make your hearing aid or implant an extra, see Cybernetic Sensory Implants on page XX.</p>
<h3 id="service-humans">Service Humans</h3>
<p>Almost any disabled person may rely on steady assistance from one or more people. In some cases, such as through
  organizational requirements (sign language interpreter) or government/private funding (group home care assistant), the
  service human officially assists with designated tasks. In other situations, the role of “service human” is filled by
  family, roommates, or friends. In considering which person or persons may regularly act as your “service human,”
  evaluate the tasks for which regular assistance enables you to navigate a world built primarily for the able-bodied.
</p>
<h4 id="official">Official</h4>
<p>As the chart on page XX indicates, almost anyone may have a service human, but you are more likely (although
  statistically still unlikely) to have some form of official assistance as a blind person (transcription, navigation),
  Deaf person (interpretation), someone with a mobility disability, or dwarfism. For example, people with mobility
  disabilities can lead generally self-sufficient lives but may have an assistant who receives a small salary to assist
  them with bathing, using the toilet, shopping, cooking, and other tasks. The service human may be a roommate in a
  group living situation or come by regularly to assist with specific tasks, such as your evening bath. In other cases,
  this role may be filled by a member of their family. Those with mental illnesses are more likely only to have official
  service humans in the form of therapists.</p>
<h4 id="and-otherwise">And Otherwise</h4>
<p>Whether through family or as part of a community, unofficial service humans provide reliable assistance while not
  receiving any payment for the role. It may be the friend or partner around whom you may safely melt down or who stays
  alert to disengage triggers before you reach meltdown point. Or it could be the classmate who has agreed to email you
  typed notes so that you can listen in class and not worry about your braille keyboard.</p>
<h4 id="extra-personal-assistant">Extra: Personal Assistant</h4>
<p><strong>Permission:</strong> A suitable disability as established by one of your character aspects.</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> One of your stunt slots or a point of refresh. Skill ranks, a rating of Good (+3) in the skill
  My Assistant.</p>
<p><strong>Skill:</strong> My Assistant. Use this skill for any action your service human undertakes that is in one of
  their identified areas of competence—essentially giving you those skills at +3, as long as your assistant is around.
</p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> Identify two Fate skills that your service human is trained in. Also specify what hours
  they have off.</p>
<h5 id="aspect">Aspect</h5>
<p>Write an aspect naming and describing your assistant. Invoke the aspect to hire the assistant to work overtime and be
  there during an off-hours scene; a compel of the aspect might establish that the current scene is happening during the
  assistant’s off hours.</p>
<h5 id="stunts">Stunts</h5>
<p>You get no free stunts with this extra.</p>

  <h4 id="sidebar-example-personal-assistant">Sidebar: Example Personal Assistant</h4>
  <p>Brian makes a character for a modern-day Mythos horror game—James Martinez, an occultist with a popular podcast—and
    decides he wants the character to have a multiple sclerosis-induced mobility disability. He takes the extra Personal
    Assistant, and decides that his assistant is a former MMA fighter and fitness instructor. Brian adds
    <strong>Patricia Cooper, Personal Assistant</strong> to his character sheet and writes the skills “Fight, Provoke
    +3” next to it. She’s off Mondays and Tuesdays, and evenings after 3. Brian also announces that she’s great at
    making healthy and delicious smoothies, but that’s not going to have any rules impact.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="variations">Variations</h5>
<p>You might be tempted in some fantasy or historical games to declare that the assistant is an indentured servant or an
  enslaved person. Please stop, think about that again, and then don’t.</p>
<p><strong>Fantasy:</strong> A demon you’ve made a bargain with, a construct or familiar</p>
<p><strong>Sci-Fi:</strong> A robot, whose off-hours might be when they’re charging. Or, if it’s a sapient AI, they
  should get time off too, right?</p>
<h3 id="communication-devices">Communication Devices</h3>
<p>Many people with severe motor control impairment, or autistic people experiencing a meltdown, are unable to speak;
  fortunately there are communications devices that range from very simple (white boards, plastic letter boards) to
  exceedingly complex (the sophisticated computerized system that Stephen Hawking used, which allowed him to deliver
  lectures about physics and calculus using a sensor that detected movement of his cheek). A d/Deaf character might
  always carry around a small paper pad and pen to ease communications. In the middle of a <strong>Meltdown</strong> an
  autistic character may converse in sign language with her service human or pull up an app which simulates texting and
  completely avoid eye contact as she passes it to others. The extra below is about devices that lean toward Professor
  Hawking’s system, although yours might run on spells rather than batteries. If your character is looking for something
  in between the two, check out the TV show <em>Speechless</em> for an example of a laser pointer and board style
  communication system.</p>
<h4 id="extra-electronic-communication-device">Extra: Electronic Communication Device</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Audio Out (Lore):</strong> Your speech system can output any sort of sound you wish, and loudly. Gain +2
    to create advantage actions when making sounds is helpful: a piercing siren, a disconcerting subaural rumble, etc.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Computerized Linguist:</strong> Not only can your speech system output spoken words in any of several
    dozen languages, but the computer can render speech you hear as text and translate it into a language you
    understand. With this computer, you will always understand and be understood.</li>
  <li><strong>Mimic (Deceive):</strong> The speech synthesizer can mimic the voice and inflection of anyone it hears for
    at least a minute. Gain +2 to Deceive overcome or create advantage actions when you’re trying to impersonate the
    voice of someone the system has heard.</li>
  <li><strong>Etiquette &amp; Protocol (Rapport):</strong> The system that translates your inputs into text is
    sophisticated enough to make wording suggestions and provide simple cultural context. Gain +2 to overcome and create
    advantage actions with Rapport when you’re persuading strangers to do you a favor or regard you as a friend.</li>

  <p>Assistive technology also includes a multitude of virtual tools that can be controlled using electronic devices
    such as smartphones, tablets, communication devices, some powered wheelchairs, etc.. For example, useful phone apps
    include magnification, voice recognition, text-to-speech, remote control capability, and so forth. “Smart” devices
    can be used to control automated house features such as temperature, lights, doors and locks, sound systems, alarm
    systems, and more.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="coping-devices">Coping Devices</h3>
<p>From weighted blankets to chewable necklaces to fidget spinners, these are your tools for staying calm in tough
  situations or recovering afterward. Your coping device may act as an anchor, like a talisman you use to remind
  yourself that depression lies. These may give you a direct advantage against mental stress, or come into play in the
  form of stunts (see Adaptive Devices and Stunts, page XX).</p>
<h3 id="medications-exercise-etc">Medications, Exercise, etc</h3>
<p>There’s a lot you can do for depression and anxiety—medication, therapy, light boxes, and there will likely be more
  for the future. If you have aspects like <strong>Light Box</strong>, <strong>My Therapist Is On Call</strong>, or
  <strong>Scrip For Citalopram</strong>, you can invoke them to help recover from consequences and conditions.</p>
<p>Never suggest that a character will get better with some outdoor time and some exercise and some relaxing yoga.
  <strong>This is a harmful trope that needs to die.</strong> Depression and anxiety are frequently caused by imbalances
  in your chemical system, or issues with your brain and the way that it functions.</p>

<h3 id="dsm">DSM</h3>
<p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM for short, has been published by the American
  Psychiatric Association (APA) since 1952 to provide a common language and standard criteria for the classification of
  mental disorders. It’s subject to many criticisms but remains a touchstone for clinicians, researchers, psychiatric
  drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, the legal system, and policy makers.
  The most recent version is the fifth edition or DSM-5, published in 2013, but many users still prefer the previous
  version, the DSM-IV-TR (or just DSM-IV, revised) released in 2000, so you may see references to either.</p>
