<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>This Open Content supplement presentsrules first seen in War of Ashes: Fate of Agaptus. They cover thefollowing:</p>
<p>Equipment stunts</p>
<p>Advancedconflict rules designed to support (but not require) use of miniatures</p>
<p>Magic basedon the blessings and curses of capricious gods</p>
<p>Wondrousartifacts from a lost civilization</p>
<p>Expanded  adventure creation mechanics</p>
<p>Re-scaling a    campaign that has been running for a while</p>
<p>Together      they can be used to play a range of fantasy adventures, from old-school      dungeon-delving with Fate rules to epics in the vein of the Odysseus&#39;s    adventures. </p>
<p>These      rules can be matched either with approaches as in War of Ashes: Fate of Agaptus or Fate Accelerated, or with skills as in Fate Core or Atomic Robo RPG. Throughout the text, we provide examples  based on both. </p>
<p><strong>Stunts</strong></p>
<p><strong>Equipment Stunts</strong></p>
<p>In a fight it can make a big difference          whether you hold a sword, a two-handed battle axe, or a potato peeler, so we          use some rules for equipment, particularly weapons and armor. </p>
<p>A              stunt can reflect specialized, high-quality, or exotic equipment that your              character has access to that gives them a frequent edge over other characters.</p>
<p>Your                  character starts with one equipment stunt, which works like a normal stunt but                  has a few additional options. If a piece of equipment is such an important part                of your character, you may even want to name it.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Effects</strong>: Equipment stunts can              take a form similar to regular or innate stunts.</p>
<p>With              skills: </p>
<p>Because                I have <strong>[describe item]</strong>, I get +2                when I <strong>[pick one: attack, defend, create                advantages, overcome]</strong> with <strong>[pick                one: Fight, Shoot]</strong> when <strong>[describe a              narrow circumstance]</strong>.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Because                  I have <strong>[describe item]</strong>, I can                  substitute my <strong>[pick one: Fight, Shoot]</strong>                  skill for <strong>[normally used skill]</strong> when                  I <strong>[pick one: attack, defend, create                  advantages, overcome]</strong> when <strong>[describe                  a narrow circumstance]</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Stiletto</strong>: Because I hide a nasty stiletto in my                    boot-top, I get +2 to attacks with Fight when my opponent have their back to                  me.</p>
<p><strong>Knight&#39;s Shield</strong>: Because I have my                  knight&#39;s shield, I get +2 to defend with Fight from opponents coming from my                left.</p>
<p><strong>Sword of Theseus</strong>: Because I wield the                ancient sword of the hero Theseus, I can use Fight instead of Provoke to create                an advantage by intimidating my opponents when they have a clear view of the brandished              sword.</p>
<p>With              approaches: </p>
<p>Because                I have <strong>[describe item]</strong>, I get +2                when I <strong>[pick one: Carefully, Cleverly,                Flashily, Forcefully, Quickly, Sneakily]__</strong>[pick one: attack, defend, create advantages, overcome]<strong> when </strong>[describe a narrow circumstance]__.</p>
<p><strong>Two-Handed Battle Axe</strong>: Because my trusty                  two-handed battle axe has a mighty arc, I get a +2 when I Quickly attack from                above (such as leaping off a building).</p>
<p><strong>My Father&#39;s Helmet</strong>: Because I have my                father&#39;s helmet, I get a +2 bonus when I Flashily create an advantage by                yelling a short encouragement to my troops on the battlefield.</p>
<p><strong>Round Buckler</strong>: Because I have a round buckler, I get a                  +2 when I Carefully defend when facing only one opponent.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon Combinations</strong>: What if you are                    specifically trained with sword and shield, or are a master of the two-sword                    technique? Do you need to spend two stunts on the combination, one for each                    hand? Not necessarily. You could attach a stunt to the combination itself,                  using the same formula as above.</p>
<p><strong>Florentine Style</strong>: Because I fight with                  sword and dagger, I get +2 when I successfully make a Fight attack against an                  opponent in single combat.</p>
<p><strong>Sword and Shield</strong>: Because I have a sword                    and shield, I get +2 when I Carefully defend against damage coming from my                  off-side.</p>
<p><strong>Lethal Damage</strong>: Lethal damage does not                  deal stress points—it goes directly to consequences (more on this in <strong>Advanced Conflict</strong> below.) If you want                  to have a weapon stunt that lets you do lethal damage instead of one of the                basic effects, it must have the form of:</p>
<p>Because                  I have <strong>[weapon]</strong>, once per session I                  deal lethal damage when I make a <strong>[pick                one: Fight, Shoot]</strong> attack successfully.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Because                    I have <strong>[weapon]</strong>, once per session I                    deal lethal damage when I make a <strong>[pick                    one: Careful, Clever, Flashy, Forceful, Quick, Sneaky]</strong> attack successfully.</p>
<p>See                        <strong>&quot;Lethal Attacks&quot;</strong> for more.</p>
<p><strong>Damascus Steel Sword</strong>: Because my damascus                          blade holds a fine edge that can pierce armor, once per session I deal lethal                        damage when I make a Fight attack successfully.</p>
<p><strong>Spiked Morningstar &quot;Skullbreaker&quot;</strong>: Because my heavy                        morningstar crushes my foes&#39; bones, once per session I deal lethal damage when                      I make a Forceful attack successfully.</p>
<p><strong>Poisoned Dagger</strong>: Because I have a                      hollow dagger with a poison reservoir, once per session I deal lethal damage                    when I make a Sneaky attack successfully.</p>
<p><strong>Zones and Ranged Weapons</strong>: An equipment stunt                    could also be used to affect opponents in other zones, or affect an entire zone                  with an attack.</p>
<p>Because                    I have <strong>[weapon with long reach or range]</strong>                    I can use <strong>[pick one: Fight, Shoot]</strong> to                    attack, create advantage, or overcome in <strong>[pick                    one: my zone and adjacent zones, up to three zones away but not in my zone]</strong>.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Because                          I have <strong>[weapon with long reach or range]</strong>                          I can <strong>[pick one: Carefully, Cleverly,                          Flashily, Forcefully, Quickly, Sneakily]</strong> attack, create advantage, or                          overcome in <strong>[pick one: my zone and                          adjacent zones, up to three zones away but not in my zone]</strong>.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Because                                I have <strong>[a weapon that affects multiple                                targets]</strong>, once per session I can attack every opponent in <strong>[pick one: my zone, an adjacent zone]</strong>.</p>
<p>See                                    also <strong>&quot;Zones and the Battlefield&quot;</strong> for                                  more info about zones.</p>
<p><strong>Hallberd</strong>: Because I whirl my hallberd with flair, I can                                  use Fight to attack, create advantages, or overcome in my zone or an adjacent                                zone.</p>
<p><strong>Bow and Arrow</strong>: Because I have a bow and arrow, I can                                use Shoot to attack, create advantages, or overcome up to three zones away, but                              not in my zone.</p>
<p><strong>Throwing Knives</strong>: Because I wield                              throwing knives, I can Quickly attack, create advantages, and overcome in my                            zone and adjacent zones.</p>
<p><strong>Alchemical Bombs</strong>: Because I create                            volatile alchemical concoctions, once per session I can attack every opponent                          in my zone.</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Shield</strong>: Because I have a heavy shield on my                          right arm, I get +2 to Forcefully push an opponent into an adjacent zone.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment Stunts and                            Weight</strong>:                            Equipment stunts can also add weight in conflicts. See <strong>&quot;Stunts and Weight&quot;</strong> for more detail and examples.</p>
<p><strong>Repair and Replacement</strong>: Damaged or lost stunt                              equipment can be repaired in play, or replaced as a stunt transfer as part of                              normal milestone advancement.</p>
<p><strong>Stunts and Weight</strong></p>
<p>Some stunts can also affect weight. They                                    typically take the form of:</p>
<p>When I use my <strong>[talent, advantage, equipment,                                        or riding beast]</strong> in <strong>[pick as                                        appropriate: social, mental, physical, etc.]</strong> conflict, my weight counts as                                        2 in <strong>[narrow circumstance]</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Battledress Armor</strong>: Because I wear my battledress, my weight counts as 2                                        when defending against physical attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Wolf Rider</strong>: When I ride my faithful dire wolf into battle, my weight                                        counts as 2 in physical conflicts against opponents of individual weight 2 or                                      less.</p>
<p><strong>Princeling</strong>: Because I am a princeling by-blow of King Olaf, my                                      weight counts as 2 in social conflicts involving Vikings.</p>
<p><strong>Barbaric Yawp</strong>: When I sound my barbaric yawp, my weight counts as 2 in                                      the first round of physical conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>Big-Ass Axe</strong>: Because I am a Giant Creature of Destruction that wields                                      a Big-Ass Axe, in physical conflicts my weight counts as 4 when I charge into                                      melee. (Takes two stunt slots, i.e., two points of refresh. An appropriate                                    stunt if playing a cave troll, for instance).</p>
<p>The                                      GM and player can decide at the table if this type of stunt would go into their                                      equipment slot or not, if applicable. Is your Big-Ass Axe considered your only                                    weapon, or do you have that and a great spear?</p>
<p><strong>Advanced                                      Conflict</strong></p>
<p>Conflicts are used to resolve situations                                          where characters are trying to harm one another, whether morally (hurting                                          feelings), socially (demolishing reputations), physically (coming to blows), or                                          through some other means. It could mean physical harm (a sword fight, a magic                                          duel, a good old fashioned bar brawl), but it could also be mental harm (a                                          shouting match, a tough interrogation, a debate between scholars).</p>
<p>Let&#39;s                                              start with a quick overview of how advanced conflict unfolds, then we&#39;ll go                                              into more detail showing you step-by-step how this plays out.</p>
<p><strong>Conflicts: The 30-Second Version</strong></p>
<p>Set the scene.</p>
<p>Determine                                                        turn order.</p>
<p>Optional:                                                        Roar phase.</p>
<p>Start                                                        the first exchange:</p>
<p>On your turn, take an                                                        action.</p>
<p>On other people&#39;s                                                        turns, defend against or respond to their actions as necessary.</p>
<p>At the end of                                                          everyone&#39;s turn, start a new exchange or end the conflict.</p>
<p><strong>Setting the Scene</strong></p>
<p>Establish what&#39;s going on, where everyone is,                                                                  and what the environment is like. Who is the opposition? The GM should write a                                                                  couple of situation aspects on sticky notes or index cards and place them on                                                                  the table. Players can suggest situation aspects, too.</p>
<p>The                                                                      GM also establishes <em>zones</em>,                                                                      loosely defined areas that tell you where characters are. Rather than                                                                      limiting—as many other games would—how far in measurement units you                                                                      can get in one unit of time, or how far you can shoot, then applying penalties                                                                      for local conditions like terrain or visibility, it skips the math and looks at                                                                      local conditions to <em>then</em> establish                                                                      how far you can move or shoot.</p>
<p>This                                                                          method is also part and parcel of <em>Fate</em>&#39;s                                                                          fractal nature, since it allows re-scaling; if you change the time unit, or the                                                                          size of the map, or both, then naturally your zones are going to change too,                                                                          while necessitating no change to the rules describing how things work.</p>
<p><strong>Zones and the Battlefield</strong></p>
<p>Even in physical conflict, zones aren&#39;t measured in yards in the                                                                                fiction or inches on a map—they&#39;re much more abstract than that. Roughly                                                                                speaking, if another combatant is close enough that you could take a few steps                                                                                and attack them with a hand-to-hand weapon, like a spear, axe, or dagger,                                                                                you&#39;re both in the same zone. In non-physical conflicts a zone might represent                                                                                areas of political influence, a clan supporting one of their own, the various                                                                                gods&#39; attention, or groups of people you can talk to.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all nice and well for a battlefield, but what about                                                                                        conflicts that don&#39;t involve coming to blows? How do you establish zones for a                                                                                        social conflict (for example, about who will become the new leader of a scout                                                                                        troop) or a mental one (for example, a debate between scholars of the Royal                                                                                      Academy of Sciences)?</p>

<p><strong>Zone Aspects</strong></p>

To that end, every zone can have a zone aspect that tells you                                                                                                  what&#39;s in it. Unlike character aspects, zone aspects shouldn&#39;t be particularly                                                                                                  nuanced. The simpler and more straightforward, the better. No matter what the                                                                                                  terrain in the zone is like, it&#39;s going to be useful in some situations and a                                                                                                  hindrance in others. An aspect that clearly communicates that in one or two                                                                                                words is ideal.</p>
<p>Keep it intuitive and broad—and short enough that it                                                                                                can easily fit on an index card. There are two good reasons for this rule of                                                                                                thumb.

Two, time spent crafting the perfect                                                                                                zone aspect is time not spent actually playing the game. Better a good zone                                                                                              aspect now than a great one in 90 seconds.</p>

Handling                                                                                                zone aspects in this way gives the players more control over their situation                                                                                                and lends a little more unpredictability to the combat. This is a create an                                                                                                advantage action, typically using Clever or Careful, and can be done from                                                                                                another zone, provided the character in question can see into the unexplored                                                                                                zone. Generally speaking, you can&#39;t replace an existing zone aspect, unless the                                                                                                aspect itself is responsible for obscuring the zone in the first place. The                                                                                                difficulty for this task should be fairly low, such as Average (+1) or Fair                                                                                                (+2). If it makes sense that a zone aspect would make the task more difficult,                                                                                                increase it by +2 for every such aspect. Likewise, if the unexplored aspect is                                                                                                more than one zone away from the character, increase the difficulty by +2 for                                                                                                every zone that separates them.</p>

To outside eyes, the                                                                                                                                  studiously intense scholar would seem to have nothing in common with the                                                                                                                                  literally-foaming-at-the-mouth barbarian warrior, but both are, in fact,                                                                                                                                roaring.</p>

With great reward, however, comes great risk, and roaring means                                                                                                                                  not having access to the full range of your usual capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a Roar Aspect</strong></p>
<p>In one respect, creating a Roar aspect is                                                                                                                                    like creating any other situational aspect—they&#39;re both just using an approach to create an advantage.                                                                                                                                  But there are three major differences when it comes to actually bringing one of                                                                                                                                  these aspect extras into being.</p>
<p>For                                                                                                                                      one, when you roar and as long as you are in this state, you are limited to                                                                                                                                      using the approach you used to create the Roar advantage, and the two connected                                                                                                                                      approaches (see the diagram).</p>
<p>Olivia                                                                                                                                          is entering a conflict with Lord Marcus Sidonius and Olivia&#39;s player wants her                                                                                                                                          to roar with Careful, so she attempts to create the advantage <strong><em>Intensely                                                                                                                                          Focused</em></strong>. Once she&#39;s roaring, she can use the free invoke from that                                                                                                                                          aspect normally, but she&#39;s limited to the Careful, Sneaky, and Clever                                                                                                                                        approaches.</p>
<p>Second,                                                                                                                                          the base difficulty to create one of these Roar aspects is +2. The players and                                                                                                                                        the GM take turns rolling for Roar aspects—that&#39;s right, the GM can create as many aspects as the                                                                                                                                      players do. How many free invocations are generated for each aspect, however,                                                                                                                                      depends on the roll results.</p>
<p>Finally,                                                                                                                                          trying and failing to create a Roar aspect means success at a cost. The Roar                                                                                                                                          aspect will be created, but along with it will come a related consequence for                                                                                                                                          the GM to use against the PC. On a tie, the GM only gets a boost against the PC                                                                                                                                          rather than a consequence. It&#39;s a tricky business, transcending the bounds of                                                                                                                                          mortal consciousness and capability. With great ambition comes great risk, and                                                                                                                                          the gods don&#39;t take kindly to hubris.

If the player compels it, it&#39;s worth a fate point,                                                                                                                                                    as usual. If the GM compels a character&#39;s Roar aspect, however, refusing a                                                                                                                                                    compel not only costs the player a fate point as usual, but also removes the                                                                                                                                                    Roar aspect from play.

<p><strong>Losing Your Roar Aspect</strong></p>
<p>A Roar aspect lasts until you choose to                                                                                                                                                        use a non-adjacent approach or until the end of the scene, whichever comes                                                                                                                                                        first. Barring any interference, of course. If the GM offers you a fate point                                                                                                                                                      to keep on Raging just as you&#39;re about to calm things down, for example, accepting means you&#39;re                                                                                                                                                      stuck with it for a while. You can pretty much count on the GM using this to                                                                                                                                                      your disfavor one way or another. What happens when the Raging barbarian can&#39;t                                                                                                                                                      stop raging, even though the only combatants still standing are his allies?                                                                                                                                                      Excellent question. Hopefully someone will survive to answer it.</p>

If Olivia wants to flee (Quick) or defend                                                                                                                                                          (Forceful), she will have to lose the Roar aspect.

<p><strong>So Why Have the Roar Phase?</strong></p>
<p>Fate veterans may wonder why we have a                                                                                                                                                                    Roar phase and its effects, if both sides can create an equal number of                                                                                                                                                                    advantageous aspects. Here&#39;s why:</p>
<p>First,                                                                                                                                                                      it&#39;s part of the setting for a lot of historical material that inspires                                                                                                                                                                      fantasy, such as ritual calling-out and boasting in many societies from Western                                                                                                                                                                    Europe to Western Africa to the Pacific Islands</p>
<p>Second,                                                                                                                                                                      even when Roar aspects aren&#39;t used directly against each other, it adds to the                                                                                                                                                                      fiction by shining a spotlight on each character in conflict and what they&#39;re                                                                                                                                                                      about. These aspects are used in a variety of ways; the Roar phase doesn&#39;t                                                                                                                                                                      guarantee a zero sum between GM and players because some of them are won by way                                                                                                                                                                      of taking a consequence before the battle even starts.</p>
<p>Third,                                                                                                                                                                          it lets you create lots of temporary aspects with free invocations you can                                                                                                                                                                          stack later (see &quot;Invoking for Effect&quot;) at the moment in combat when the enemy                                                                                                                                                                          is not trying to hurt you yet, so you don&#39;t have to worry about defending.</p>
